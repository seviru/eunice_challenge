	content: Aethir, a project for decentralized GPU cloud computing, and Filecoin Foundation are establishing an alliance to provide clients with enterprise-grade solutions to support their businesses with decentralized infrastructure, according to a blog post: "As part of our collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation, Aethir will explore GPU leasing to Filecoin’s storage providers, thus providing Filecoin’s infrastructure network with a reliable and secure source of GPU cloud computing supplies. In parallel to becoming sealing-as-a-service providers, some of Filecoin’s storage providers can borrow GPU capacity from Aethir if they need excess processing power to seal data onto Filecoin’s network... Aethir’s vast network of 43,000+ top-grade GPUs and our premium selection of 3000+ NVIDIA H100s for advanced GPU workloads can provide a highly scalable and trustworthy solution for all Filecoin storage providers needing additional GPU resources." From a press release: "Additionally, Aethir has integrated with Lighthouse, a platform built on Filecoin offering perpetual storage, encryption, custom gateways and multi-chain smart contracts. Aethir plans to upload AI and node-focused data to the Filecoin network, via Lighthouse. By archiving critical data sets such as TensorOpera Fox-1 to the Filecoin network, Aethir is ensuring transparency, accountability and robust audit trails for AI model governance. Moving forward, Aethir plans to expand its use of Filecoin storage solutions to archive chain state data, enhance data management capabilities, and drive the vision of a fully decentralized ecosystem with minimized operational costs." CoinDesk 20 asset: (FIL) Wormhole, a blockchain interoperability project, announced its largest platform overhaul to date, Era3. According to the team, "This entails expanded integrations of intents and NTT, composable intents, a full-service offering for token transfers/cross-chain swap and Wormhole scan, a tool for improving transaction tracking capabilities and analytics. Core to Era3 is the launch of the Wormhole Institutional offering for financial and enterprise use cases, with institutional partners like Securitize and Google Cloud as early adopters." {{W}} Zeta Markets, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on Solana, unveiled Bullet – described as Solana’s first layer-2 solution – along with the latest version of Zeta X, at Solana Breakpoint 2024. According to the team: "Bullet, a zkVM-based L2 rollup, aims to solve issues like block times, latency and network congestion, enhancing Solana's performance. Bullet's testnet will launch in Q4 2024, with the mainnet expected in early 2025. Zeta X, the first super app on Bullet, will offer a CEX-like experience with features such as 100x leverage, near-instant confirmations, and advanced chain abstraction." Telos Foundation, supporting the Telos blockchain, announced the launch of its new crypto exchange, Telos X. According to the team: "Telos X will also act as a key component within the Telos Network, which currently powers hundreds of unique dApps, including NewLife, Zeptagram, Seeds, Wordproof, Appics, Qubicles, Qudo and Taikai." Abra, a platform for digital asset services, has partnered with Praxis, described as "the first network state," to collaborate on real world asset tokenization, as well as DeFi services to network states, including those created on the Praxis platform. According to the team: "Praxis and Abra intend to create an on-chain database of real estate, businesses, citizenship, contracts, marketplaces and other on-chain DeFi (decentralized financial) services that interact seamlessly with both online communities and physical cities." Soulbound, a Web3 social gaming ecosystem, will launch its Web3 live streaming platform at TwitchCon San Diego, starting September 20, 2024. The semi-annual convention organized by Twitch will provide an opportunity for Soulbound to present its platform. Soulbound is backed by investors including Animoca Brands, NGC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings. The platform is designed to offer content monetization, community interactions and enhanced creator and viewer experiences." Blockchain storage layer Xandeum is revealing its blueprint for scaling Solana storage at Breakpoint 2024. According to the team, the project is introducing “Xandeum buckets,” described as "an exabytes+ scalable file system integrated directly into Solana RPC nodes. Storage will be offloaded to a decentralized network of hundreds of thousands of storage provider nodes (pNodes), supervised by Xandeum-enabled Solana validators. PNodes, validators, & liquid stakers will earn additional rewards in SOL, thanks to highly dynamic fee markets designed to optimize storage efficiency and profitability." Worldcoin, the blockchain identity network known for its iris-scanning orbs as well as its affiliation with OpenAI founder Sam Altman, introduced Face Auth, a new security measure for World ID. According to the team: "Face Auth is a private 1:1 face comparison that ensures only the person who verified their World ID at an orb can use it. It provides increased security for your World ID during actions like online purchases, financial transactions, secure sign-in applications and much more." The Polkadot community released its latest major product, Agile Coretime, as part of the ongoing Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. According to the team: "This new feature represents a significant advancement in how computational resources are allocated and managed within the Polkadot ecosystem... This new approach replaces the previous auction system, in which single cores were leased for two years at a time." Accoding to the project documentation: "Agile Coretime allows for the purchase of coretime in 'bulk,' with an allocation for one month. Heavy duty parachains which need to author a block every 12 seconds (or every six seconds through Asynchronous Backing), can seamlessly 'renew' the core each month. Coretime renewal orders take precedence over new orders and provide protection against price fluctuations, allowing parachains to plan their project budget and costs more effectively. The purchased coretime can also be split up and sold in parts, down to a single block per month, allowing for secondary markets to thrive and improve the allocation efficiency of coretime." Core usage before, with Polkadot 1.0: After, with Polkadot 2.0 and Agile Coretime: Privado ID, formerly Polygon ID, which has established proofs-of-concept with several multinational banking and financial service companies, announced a strategic merger with Disco, a pioneer in multichain verifiable data and reputation management. According to the team: "The merger will propel the development and adoption of a unified, chain-agnostic digital identity infrastructure spanning both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, and for the first time see Privado ID become available in chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base and others with Privado ID's own established partnerships and scalable infrastructure." The press release stated: "By leveraging Disco’s Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Privado ID enhances cross-chain compatibility enabling it to expand its services across multiple EVM-compatible chains." Midnight Network, a new layer-1 data protection blockchain, has released its litepaper, “Nightpaper." The paper aims to "demonstrate how the network enables apps that protect user, commercial and transaction metadata. The Nightpaper explains how Midnight has solved a new blockchain trilemma: using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for utility without compromising data protection or ownership." Solana Labs's phone designing subsidiary is slated to ship its second crypto phone in 2025, Solana Mobile announced at the Token 2049 conference on Thursday. Called Seeker, the upcoming handheld will be a major hardware improvement over Solana's first mobile phone, with better battery, a stronger camera and a lighter design than the Saga, said Emmet Hollyer, who runs Solana Labs' phonemaking project. CoinDesk 20 asset: (SOL) Civic, developer of a tokenized identity solution on the verifiable web, has partnered with Rentality, described as the first Web3 car rental platform, "to securely verify drivers' licenses and enforce age minimums on the Base network." According to the team: "Using Civic's ID Verification Pass, users can verify licenses virtually, streamlining the car rental process. This solution enhances security, trust and compliance in car rentals and peer-to-peer marketplaces by eliminating the need for physical verification and reducing friction in the transaction, setting a new standard for secure rentals." Chromia, a blockchain ecosystem that aims to avoid network congestion partly by giving every decentralized app (dapp) its own cluster of nodes and computational resources, announced the upcoming "Asgard" mainnet upgrade on the TOKEN2049 stage, along with a $20 million Data and AI Ecosystem Fund. According to the team: "The fund is aimed at supporting data-intensive projects and AI-enabled applications. Asgard, scheduled for Q4 2024, will introduce 'Extensions' – customized chains designed to bring new functionalities to the platform such as oracles, computation for AI models, support for data availability and ZK proofs." Jade City, a RWA platform specifically designed for tokenization of the $50 billion-plus jade market, released its white paper. According to the team: "The Jade City white paper outlines how the new platform will kick off a new era of RWA tokenization when it launches later in 2024, detailing its supply and value chain, supply and distribution partners, revenue and token model, and ongoing roadmap." According to the white paper: "The economy of Jade City is powered by a community-funded value chain. The Jade City community gains access to raw material by purchasing a treasury bond with a stablecoin such as USDT. These funds are used to acquire jade early in the value chain. In return, part of the profit generated from processing and sales is given back to bond holders in the form of tokenized physical jade. The majority of the remaining profit is used to buy. and burn the $JCT token, channeling value to the token holders." The project was co-founded by the owners of the largest jade deposit, the paper reads. According to a spokesperson, the project is being built on Base, with a beta platform expected in early October. ChainOpera AI, a decentralized and open AI platform, has emerged from stealth, according to the team. The project is "launching its decentralized platform and app marketplace that enables developers to build, train, and deploy AI applications using fully decentralized resources. While existing decentralized AI solutions focus on infrastructure like GPUs, they still rely on centralized providers like AWS. ChainOpera fills this gap by delivering enterprise-grade AI models and decentralized infrastructure, providing cost-effective GPU access, community-sourced AI training, and a marketplace for apps built on its decentralized infrastructure." Oasis Network, designed to be a scalable, privacy-first and versatile layer-1 blockchain, has launched liquid staking in partnership with Accumulated Finance, according to the team: "ROSE token holders can now stake their assets while keeping them liquid for trading or use in DeFi applications. This new feature, powered by the Oasis Sapphire ecosystem, provides stROSE, a liquid staking token, allowing users to earn rewards and engage with decentralized apps. Improvements include boosted staking APR and a reduced unbonding period." Users no longer have a 14-day unbonding period when converting staked ROSE to unstaked ROSE, a blog post reads. MatrixPort, a digital asset services platform, and exSat, a docking layer for Bitcoin scalability, plan to work together to introduce nBTC, a wrapped bitcoin alternative, "to improve liquidity and enable diverse financial applications such as staking and lending," according to the team: MatrixPort "will leverage its technology and user base, while exSat focuses on indexing UTXO data. The strategic partnership is set to position exSat as the biggest among Bitcoin L2s, with ~$400 million at launch." RedStone, a leading provider of blockchain oracles, announced the integration of its data feeds into the TON (The Open Network) blockchain. According to the team: "This integration empowers developers and users with fast, gas-efficient and secure data solutions. It is the first and only oracle solution to offer price feeds for TON. By continually expanding its data feeds to meet the evolving demands of the TON ecosystem and deploying production infrastructure to support high-demand asset prices, RedStone is dedicated to fostering the continued growth of TON’s DeFi landscape." Aethir and GameCentric announced a collaboration to enhance Web3 gaming using Aethir’s decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure. According to the team: "This integration boosts GameCentric’s scalability, security, and performance, supporting its expansion into in-game tokens, non-custodial wallets, and a marketplace. This collaboration enables GameCentric to lead in emerging markets while elevating player experiences across Web2 and Web3." Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange, Fortune reported on Thursday. The round was led by led by Multicoin Capital. Drift plans to build an array of financial services tools, including spot and derivatives trading and a predictions market to become the "Robinhood of crypto," co-founder Cindy Leow said, according to the report. The company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year.

	title: Prediction Markets Go to Washington('s Appeals Court)
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-20-2024 16:00:00
	content: The CFTC is working to ban political prediction markets. Its current goal: Get a federal appeals court to keep one from launching while it argues a judge was mistaken in overturning its rejection of Kalshi. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. It's unclear whether political prediction markets will launch in the U.S. before the election (I'm not counting Kalshi's 8-hour effort last week). The ball's in an appeals court to make a decision one way or another, and a 2.5-hour hearing on Thursday elicited few clues about where the judges may land. While Kalshi's prediction markets aren't directly crypto-related, if Kalshi does win the ability to list and trade political event contracts, it may open the door for other providers to enter – or possibly re-enter – the U.S. market. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the middle of a rulemaking process to ban political prediction markets in the U.S. entirely by formally adding these types of event contracts to the definition of "gaming." That effort took a major blow last week, when District of Columbia District Judge Jia Cobb ruled against the regulator in Kalshi v. CFTC. Some quick background: Kalshi tried to self-certify political prediction markets in 2023, but the CFTC ordered that the company could not list or trade those products. Kalshi sued, and on Sept. 6, the judge ruled that Kalshi won – though she didn't actually publish her opinion explaining the ruling until Sept. 12. The full opinion goes into detail about how the judge assessed the CFTC's definition of "gaming" and "involves" as they pertain to the statute (the Commodity Exchange Act) the regulator used to reject the products. The CFTC filed an emergency stay for appeal hours after Kalshi launched its new contracts, willing at least a temporary halt while the appeals court judges consider the emergency motion. As of the time I'm writing this, the contracts are still halted. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for Thursday, giving each party 15 minutes to make its case – though ultimately it ran for some 2.5 hours. We'll presumably find out if the contracts can restart before the election happens after the hearing, but there's no firm timeline here. And of course, there's still the broader question about the appeal itself and how that may go. The broader picture, of course, is the CFTC's ongoing rulemaking around the role of political prediction markets in the U.S. The CFTC's view is it shouldn't be responsible for overseeing these because it'd be too difficult for the regulator to police the underlying market – i.e. the results of the U.S. elections – for fraud and manipulation. The markets themselves may be subject to manipulation through the use of misleading or false polling data, CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz argued in court Thursday. And manipulation on prediction markets may further undermine confidence in elections themselves. Kalshi's view is these concerns are besides the point, because Congress authorized the CFTC to block certain types of event contracts and election markets aren't on the list. "Their argument comes down to characterizing these event contracts as involving either gaming or unlawful activity," said Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth. "The problem as to both is that the Commission's interpretations of how the statute works and how this link what this language means are so broad that they would sweep all event contracts, thereby rendering the other enumerated activity superfluous and flipping the whole structure of how this statute works. And they have not been able to give a limiting principle." Roth represents Kalshi in its case against the CFTC. Schwartz pointed to the Commodity Exchange Act and its preemption of state laws in his argument, noting that some states have laws banning election wagers. The CEA preempts state law, so allowing Kalshi to list political event contracts may run into conflicts with those laws, in one hypothetical. The judges grilled both attorneys, seemingly unimpressed by either over the course of the 2.5-hour hearing (which was originally set to last 30 minutes). It remains to be seen how they'll rule on the temporary stay.

	title: Consensys Suit Against U.S. SEC Dismissed by Texas Court
	author: Jesse Hamilton
	published_at: 09-20-2024 15:48:21
	content: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had – for a time – added Consensys to a list of crypto investigation targets, prompting the technology incubator company to sue it for overreach in federal court. Because the regulator then shut down that Ethereum probe earlier this year, a Texas judge has decided the lack of immediate danger means the lawsuit is unwarranted. Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted in a Thursday filing that "because withholding consideration subjects plaintiff to scant, if any, hardship, the claim lacks a ripe case or controversy." In other words, since there's no clear future threat to Consensys, there's no point in this judge weighing in. "In a significant win for the industry, the SEC dropped its 'Ethereum 2.0' investigation after our litigation was filed, and the Texas court today recognized that the SEC already gave Consensys the relief it sought on that critical issue for the Ethereum ecosystem," the company said in a post on X. Read More: SEC Ends Probe Into Consensys, Won't Sue Over Ethereum Consensys argued that its lawsuit "laid bare the overzealous investigation of Ethereum, and policymakers and the public at large voiced deep concern over the SEC’s investigation of blockchain software development." A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the case being dismissed. When Consensys sued the agency in April, it asked the court to declare that Ethereum's ether (ETH) is not a security and that any investigation of ConsenSys based on the idea that the token is a security would trample on the company's rights. It also contended that MetaMask is not a broker under federal law and that its staking service doesn't violate securities law. After backing down in the ETH investigation, the SEC did follow up with charges against Consensys later in June, alleging that the company's MetaMask service was acting as an unregistered securities broker. While the SEC hasn't made a public statement about ETH's status, last week, the regulator settled charges with eToro which let the trading platform continue listing ETH in the U.S. UPDATE (September 20, 2022, 18:16 UTC): Adds decline to comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	title: MicroStrategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings With $458M Purchase, Upsized Convertible Note Offering to $1B
	author: Krisztian  Sandor
	published_at: 09-20-2024 14:19:49
	content: Nasdaq-listed software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Friday that it purchased 7,420 bitcoin (BTC) for about $458.2 million using the proceeds of its debt offering. The acquisition happened between Sept. 13 and 19 at an average BTC price of approximately $61,750. The company increased its convertible note issuance that concluded Thursday to $1.01 billion from the $700 million principal offering announced earlier this week, according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's bitcoin yield, a novel metric that measures the percentage change in the company's BTC holdings relative to its assumed fully diluted shares outstanding, increased to 5.1% for this quarter, up from 4.4% on September 13, company filings show. The company, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has been a pioneer for bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset, and has become the largest corporate holder of BTC since it started buying in 2020. With the latest purchase, the firm now holds 252,220 bitcoin worth nearly $16 billion at current prices, acquiring at an average BTC price of $39,266 for a total cost of $9.9 billion. The firm still has some $889 million left from its $2 billion ATM equity issuance to acquire more BTC, per last week's regulatory filing. MicroStrategy's shares were down 1.5% from Thursday's market closing price, with U.S. equity indices and BTC also sliding lower. Other public companies such as Semler Scientific, miner Marathon Digital and Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet recently have followed MicroStrategy's footprints to issue debt to accumulate BTC.

	content: The YouTube channel of India’s Supreme Court was compromised on Friday in a first such incident for the judicial body. The channel, which otherwise streams court cases for viewers and the press, showed videos promoting XRP tokens. Its name was changed to “Ripple.live24.” A blank video titled "Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple Responds To The SEC's $2 Billion Fine! XRP PRICE PREDICTION" went live on the channel in the European morning hours. The video and the channel were taken down shortly afterward. “This is to inform all concerned that the YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India has been taken down. The services on YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India will be resumed shortly,” the Supreme Court said in a statement shared with local media companies. The compromise came ahead of several crucial cases scheduled for Friday, the Times of India reported. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

	title: Jump's 'Frankendancer' Validator Client Is Live on Solana Mainnet
	author: Danny Nelson
	published_at: 09-20-2024 07:50:25
	content: SINGAPORE — An early version of Jump Crypto's highly anticipated Solana validator, Firedancer, is live and contributing to the performance of the Solana blockchain, Jump's Chief Science Officer Kevin Bowers said Friday. Speaking onstage at Solana's Breakpoint conference, Bowers shed light on an "open secret" in Solana's validator community: Some of the computing power underpinning Solana is running "Frankendancer" software that combines predominant validator tech with new contributions from Jump. Blockchain validators ingest transactions and construct blocks – the most essential process in running a blockchain. Most networks have a single validator client. Solana's plan to have two fully independent validators – one from a Solana spinoff team, Anza, one from Jump – would give it a redundancy boost, and potentially a performance edge, too. Such behind-the-scenes and in-the-weeds tech developments might seem like a yawner, but at Breakpoint it received top billing. The sellout conference's largest stage was standing room only as Bowers emerged to a rockstar-like atmosphere. "We view this project as the consumer science equivalent of civil engineering," Bowers said of the effort to build the second validator client. He compared the potential impact of Firedancer as akin to expanding a country road into an interstate highway. Bowers shed little light on when Firedancer – the fully new client software, as opposed to Frankendancer – would come online. But it is running on testnet, Bowers said, indicating it has achieved minimum viability and is getting close. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: SocGen's Crypto Unit Takes Euro Stablecoin to Solana After Flopping on Ethereum
	author: Danny Nelson

	content: SINGAPORE – SG Forge, a subsidiary of Societe Generale, will roll out euro stablecoin EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on the Solana blockchain, the French financial services firm said Friday. SG Forge launched EURCV on the Ethereum blockchain last year as a highly regulated, euro-centric alternative to top dollar-linked stablecoins from Tether and Circle. It has struggled to catch on: EURCV has only 28 holders, 154 lifetime transactions and an issuance of 33 million, according to its Etherscan page. The Solana debut will test whether crypto users have any appetite for Euro-linked stablecoins on a faster and cheaper network, two attributes SG Forge touted in a press release. CEO Jean-Marc Stenger said in the presser that Solana's speed "will unlock new possibilities for both retail users and institutional players in" decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are becoming systemically important to the global financial economy, Bernstein wrote in a recent report. Myriad firms are eager to replicate the success of Circle and Tether, the largest stablecoin issuers who collect major windfalls from ownership of the Treasury notes underlying their respective assets.

	content: Crypto exchange BingX has been hacked for a "minor" amount of assets and the exchange plans to compensate users for any loss, the firm's chief product officer (CPO) said in a message on X. On-chain data suggests nearly $43 million was stolen from the exchange in multiple tranches, with $13.25 million ether, $2.3 million BNB, $4.4 million USDT, among other being drained. The first hack was for approximately $26 million, while a few hours afterward, hackers took an additional $16.5 million from the exchange. "The total loss is minimal and manageable. This incident will not affect our ongoing business operations," BingX CPO Vivien Lien said on X. "Trading services continue as usual. Withdrawals and deposits are temporarily delayed and are expected to be restored within 24 hours at the latest." Aside from stablecoins, hackers took more than 360 different types of altcoins. Data from Etherscan shows most of the stolen crypto was swapped for ETH and BNB at DEXs like Uniswap and Kyberswap. As of press time the wallet tied to the hack, which Etherscan says received most of its funds from the BingX hot wallet, has over 1,000 ether in it and tokens worth $5 million.

	title: Crypto Investment Firm Deus X Capital Unveils DeFi Unit Which Will Start New Yield Generating Protocol
	author: Will Canny
	published_at: 09-20-2024 00:00:00
	content: Deus X Capital, the $1 billion investment and operating company led by Tim Grant, today launched Solstice Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) business, the company said in a press release on Friday. Solstice Labs is building institutional-grade DeFi products and protocols that will be available to all investors, the company said. The business' first project is a protocol that offers enhanced yield opportunities, and is expected to go live in early 2025, Deus X said. It aims to deliver stable and consistent yields for investors, Ben Nadareski, co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview, and in a democratized fashion, as all users will have the same access to this yield generating opportunity on the Solstice protocol. The protocol will be developed on the Solana blockchain, and is expected to launch with more than $100 million of total value locked (TVL), with significant investment from Deus X Capital. Nadareski, who is currently an investment director at Deus X Capital, is co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs. Tim Grant, CEO of Deus X Capital will be co-founder and chairman of the company. Stuart Connolly, chief investment officer at Deus X and CEO of Alpha Lab 40, is to join the firm as chief investment officer and co-founder. "Many DeFi products and protocols have been built using exceptional technology stacks like we have seen with Solana but have largely been overlooked for institutional applications," said Nadareski, in the release. "This presents a huge opportunity to introduce institutional-grade yield-opportunities and infrastructure into DeFi which will allow for a far broader range of investment participation," he added. Solstice Labs will work closely with Cor Prime, a prime broker, and Alpha Lab 40, a proprietary trading firm, both of which are portfolio companies of Deus X Capital. Cor Prime launched on Wednesday with a $100 million commitment of risk capital from Deus X Capital, and the company plans to address the supply/demand imbalance for leverage in the crypto market. Deus X Capital launched in October last year with $1 billion of assets, including existing investments and capital to be deployed.

	title: U.S. Election Betting: CFTC, Kalshi Both Grilled by Judges in Appeals Court
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-19-2024 22:06:11
	content: A panel of judges grilled attorneys for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and prediction-betting platform Kalshi over the company's efforts to launch political prediction markets in the U.S., without indicating whether they'd allow Kalshi to offer these products while reviewing a lower court's ruling on the products. CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz and Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth took turns explaining why an appeals court should or should not block Kalshi from listing these events contracts. The Thursday hearing came days after a federal judge ruled that the CFTC could not block Kalshi from listing political prediction markets, letting the company list contracts predicting how control of the House and Senate might play out. But it only lasted for a few hours, since the CFTC quickly filed for an emergency stay, which the appeals court granted on a temporary basis. During the 2.5-hour hearing, the judges did not seem especially impressed by either party, saying various arguments or explanations did not make sense and drilling into specific terms of the Commodity Exchange Act and what they mean. The judges did not get to asking what an event contract actually is until more than two hours into the hearing. The CFTC's Schwartz called D.C. District Court Judge Jia Cobb's Sept. 12 ruling "seriously flawed," and said it could allow Kalshi – and other companies – to immediately launch "high-stakes" betting markets. "If that happens, the harm to the public is going to be profound at a time, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but Americans broadly believe that our democracy is under threat," Schwartz said. "In order to obtain a stay, the commission has to show two things: merit, and that there will be some harm, irreparable harm, absent the stay, and they can't make either of those," Roth said in his opening statement. Kalshi saw $50,000 deposited in its two political events contracts in the eight hours or so that the products were live before the CFTC filed for an emergency stay, Roth said. The CFTC's arguments revolve around the agency's stated inability to police the underlying events – namely, U.S. elections. Market participants could distort markets to suggest one candidate is doing better than another, Schwartz said, and it would be more difficult to correct than other markets. A judge posed the hypothetical question of whether a counterparty might take the other side of a bet made for manipulative purposes: "Somebody will take the other side and eat their lunch. Is that what's supposed to happen?" That is what should happen, but political prediction markets may be susceptible to manipulation that cannot be easily corrected, Schwartz said. "It's because the sources of information that they absorb and reflect are opaque and unreliable. I am talking about polls with undisclosed methodologies, so, bad methodologies, fake polls, pollsters with agendas, inaccurate news, fake news, on and on," he said. "Normal futures contracts have an objective indicator that is reliable, kind of a published index report." If these markets are manipulated, that would both harm the market participants and could even undermine election integrity, Schwartz said. Later in the hearing, he drew a distinction between political event contracts and other types of bets that could be placed. "There's really very little monkeying around you can do with an earthquake," Schwartz said, responding to one example. Roth, speaking on Kalshi's behalf, pushed back, saying the more robust a market is, the less susceptible it would be to that type of manipulation. He pointed to the $1 billion already bet on Polymarket, which does not offer services in the U.S. after a settlement with the CFTC, saying the regulator's argument essentially suggests having an overseas vendor provide these products may be better than Kalshi doing so. "The most important thing I want to make is that the way to reduce that risk is to allow Kalshi markets to offer because right now, this activity is happening and being reported to voters based on markets that are not regulated, that are open to foreign traders, that have no surveillance. … There's no transparency," he said. "We don't know who's buying, who's selling cryptocurrency. If this was happening on Kalshi's markets, we would have this whole suite of regulatory provisions that apply." The CFTC needed to show there was a risk of "irreparable harm" in allowing Kalshi to continue listing and trading its events contracts. Todd Phillips, an assistant professor of law at the Georgia State University Robinson College of Business, told CoinDesk it was "unclear if [the CFTC] did that" over the course of the hearing. The regulator could have done a better job explaining what event contracts actually are and how a state prohibiting gambling on elections counts as gaming for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act, he said. On the other hand, Kalshi also faced tough questioning from the panel of judges on the appeals court. "Kalshi is making an argument that 'you should allow us to do something that 29 states prohibit, and that's big," he said. "That would be effectively overturning the law in more than half the country. Marc Hochstein contributed reporting. Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: German Government Shuts Down 47 Exchanges, Says They're Tied To ‘Illegal Activity’
	author: Helene Braun
	published_at: 09-19-2024 20:46:21
	content: The German Attorney General's Office Frankfurt am Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) and the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) have shut down 47 crypto exchanges allegedly tied to criminal activities including money laundering. The exchanges purposefully failed to comply with their obligation to carry out certain identity and background checks on their customers, also known as “know your customer” (KYC) requirements, the BKA said in a press release on Thursday. Some of the exchanges include Xchange.cash, 60cek.org, Baksman.com, alongside other smaller platforms. One of the exchanges had been active since 2012 while others had launched as recently as the previous year. Some customer and transaction data was seized by the government in the process of the investigation, it said. Given that the people behind those activities often reside in other countries outside of Germany, where criminal activities like this are “tolerated or even protected,” the authorities noted it may be nearly impossible for German government officials to prosecute them. Instead, they will focus on “weakening” the underlying infrastructure that allowed for those illegal activities, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the BKA seized 49,857 bitcoin (BTC), worth $2.1 billion at the time, from the operators of a privacy website called Movie2k.to, which was shut down in 2013 for violating the Copyright Act. The agency proceeded to sell the tokens in July, causing distress in the global crypto markets due to the selling pressure resulting from the dump as well as the simultaneous repayments by defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which happened around the same time. Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Does SBF’s Appeal Stand a Chance of Succeeding?
	author: Ben Schiller
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:34:23
	content: It’s been about 10 months since Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. It’s been about six months since he was sentenced (in March) to 25 years in federal prison. In that time, the crypto industry has moved on: markets are up, VC dollars are back, and politicians are once again supporting the industry. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has almost forgotten about the fallen crypto king, SBF himself.  So might a judge and jury see SBF’s case differently should it hear evidence from the FTX founder again? That certainly seems to be the hope of SBF’s new legal team, which took over his case after his trial lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, stepped down following his conviction. On Friday, Sept. 13, his new lead lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, laying out why SBF believes he deserves another hearing. “In the United States, people accused of crimes are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” Shapiro's appeal begins. “They are entitled to a fair trial by a jury. When the government introduces evidence, defendants have the right to rebut that evidence and present their side of the story. That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work. But none of that happened here.” The 102-page document argues that SBF was unfairly treated at trial, which took place as public scrutiny of the FTX case reached a fever pitch. Shapiro argues SBF was “presumed guilty by federal prosecutors eager for quick headlines,” “presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial,” and that the “prevailing narrative” of FTX’s collapse, and SBF’s part in it, was accepted as true, without proper inquiry. “From day one, the prevailing narrative—initially spun by the lawyers who took over FTX, quickly adopted by their contacts at the U.S. Attorney’s Office—was that Bankman-Fried had stolen billions of dollars of customer funds, driven FTX to insolvency, and caused billions in losses,” the appeal continues. “Now, nearly two years later, a very different picture is emerging—one confirming FTX was never insolvent, and in fact had assets worth billions to repay its customers. But the jury at BankmanFried’s trial never got to see that picture.” SBF has long maintained that FTX was never really insolvent and it was forced into bankruptcy unnecessarily. It notes that, under the bankruptcy settlement, nearly all its customers are being made whole. Shapiro says Judge Lewis A. Kaplan deprived the jury of “Brady” evidence favorable to the defendant, including that SBF made good investments (such as in Anthropic, the AI startup) alongside the bad ones. However, lawyers contacted by CoinDesk were skeptical that SBF would win a retrial, given the high bar for such legal turnovers. “It’s just not very common for an appellate court to double-guess a case like this,” said Tama Beth Kudman, partner at Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner. SBF’s lawyers would have to prove not only that Kaplan was biased against SBF, she said, and also that such bias led to actions that were prejudicial against SBF. To allow the appeal to go forward, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would be saying effectively that it thought the judge in the original case acted inappropriately – something it rarely does, Kudman said. The appeals court might order a retrial if SBF's lawyers could show that Kaplan had a personal conflict of interest. But there’s no evidence for that, thus far. “Kaplan is known as a well-tempered, good natured judge. I would have thought he would have stepped aside if there was any reason that he shouldn’t be hearing the case,” Kudman said. Joshua Ashley Klayman, the U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters, said the appeal may have been timed to coincide with sentencing for Caroline Ellison, SBF’s former colleague and sometime lover. U.S. government lawyers have not requested jail time for Ellison, noting that the SBF case would have been “difficult to prove” without her testimony. Shapiro may be trying to juxtapose SBF’s steep sentencing with Ellison’s much lighter penalty. “Without expressing a view on the likelihood of success of Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal, the timing of his filing may be strategic," Klayman said. "SBF’s appeal was filed on September 13, 2024, three days after the filing of Caroline Ellison’s sentencing memorandum. SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison’s counsel has requested a non-custodial sentence." Klayman said news that FTX creditors are being repaid could help SBF's legal team. “The mainstream media has reported on FTX’s plans to repay customers. Perhaps SBF and his counsel may hope that, with the passage of time, SBF’s arguments [that FTX customers didn’t lose money] may be viewed in a different light." Joe Valenti, partner in the White Collar & Government Enforcement practice at law firm Saul Ewing, says appeals courts tend to give significant discretion to judges in weighing evidence, provided they meet a basic standard of reasonableness. "Anything that's tied to the reading of the facts, or the conduct of the courtroom, they give significant leeway to the court," he said. Judges are allowed to control the courtroom in the interest of expeditious justice and limiting evidence from being admitted to the record is well within the discretion of the judge. As for the argument that customers are being made whole in bankruptcy, Valenti doesn't see that argument holding much water either. "It doesn't matter if the money was paid back. If you're a cashier at the supermarket and you take $20 to go to the casino, it doesn’t matter if you give back the money the next day. You still took money from the grocery store."

	title: Ethereum Developers Confirm Plan to Split 'Pectra' Upgrade In Two
	author: Margaux Nijkerk
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:15:58
	content: Ethereum developers agreed on Thursday to split their upcoming hard fork, Pectra, into two packages, in a move to make the massive upgrade less unwieldy and reduce the risk of missteps or bugs. The decision to split up the upgrade wasn't unexpected. Developers had discussed previously that Pectra was becoming too ambitious to ship all at once, floating the idea of splitting it up in order to minimize the risk of finding bugs in the code. Pectra was on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork is the technical term for when a blockchain splits from its original, and is the method used by Ethereum to implement major software upgrades.) Now, developers will be able to focus on a much narrower scope. Previously, developers shared they would aim to have the upgrade live in early 2025; that is still the case for the first part of the Pectra package. The core developers decided that eight Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) will be included in the first package, which includes EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets, and famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes. The second package is up to be changed over the next few months, but as of now could include proposals that aim to make changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, known as EOF, along with introducing a feature called PeerDAS, which improves data availability sampling and ultimately is beneficial for layer-2 blockchains. The developers acknowledged that the scopes of these upgrades can change over time, so solidifying this upgrade wouldn't be wise in this moment. "There seems to be agreements to split current Pectra somehow," said Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes, who led the call. "And then downstream, we can figure out what comes next." “I hear everyone that, it can be tricky to not want to put new things in. I would lean towards, again, keeping the scope very small, just because then that's going to maximize our chances of actually shipping the second fork very quickly with respect to this first one,” Stokes added.

This is Crypto for Advisors, after all, so in today’s issue, Roxanna Islam from TMX VettaFi takes us through crypto demand and adoption since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. In Ask an Expert, Bryan Courchesne, CEO of DAIM, looks at whether advisors are supporting their clients investments in crypto and, if not, where the risks lie. – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Many of us thought that the launch of spot crypto ETFs would help bring crypto into the mainstream and encourage adoption - particularly by closing the gap between advisors and their clients. While the spot bitcoin ETF launch in January broke records, demand for spot Ethereum ETFs has been muted. And now with no near-term approval for Solana ETFs, this raises the question – does interest in crypto ETFs end with bitcoin? I believe there will be more to the crypto ETF story, but there are three big questions we need to answer about demand. 1. Are clients ACTUALLY interested in crypto? Seasoned crypto investors see the benefit of investing directly in cryptocurrencies – not just bitcoin. However, crypto ETFs brought access to other groups of investors, including retail investors who are newer to crypto and more comfortable with a traditional vehicle like an ETF. And unlike the old-school crypto investor, newer investors may be satisfied with a simpler approach to cryptocurrency investing (i.e., investing in just bitcoin ETFs). Despite the fact that bitcoin and ether (symbol ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) have two very different use cases, it is very easy to use bitcoin as a “just for fun” investment without fully diversifying their crypto allocation. This has been reflected in net flows for crypto launches. Excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $37.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January, with net inflows for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bringing in $20.9 billion of those flows. Since their launch in July, spot ether ETFs have seen net inflows of only $2.1 billion (excluding the flagship Grayscale product). The highest inflows were seen in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which had only $1.0 billion net inflows – a significant gap from its spot bitcoin counterpart. While I believe interest in spot Ether will grow over time, these trends indicate that mainstream investors still haven’t fully embraced crypto. 2. Are advisors WILLING to allocate to crypto? Given a niche portion of clients interested in crypto ETFs, the next step is making sure advisors are also open to conversation. The survey results shown below are important because 64% of advisors surveyed—that’s almost two-thirds of advisors—are neutral to negative on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bloomberg Terminal data show that the majority of investors who own spot crypto products are self-directed investors—not those who invest through an advisor. According to this data, 80% of shares held of iShares’ (IBIT) and 75% of shares held of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) are by investors who do not file 13Fs (i.e., self-directed clients). Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to getting advisors more interested in this asset class. Education – not just for investors, but also focused on advisors – will be the primary solution. Education takes time but should become easier as time passes and ease acceptance among both clients and advisors. 3. CAN advisors allocate to crypto? Assuming both clients and advisors are interested, there are still some barriers to investing. Many large brokerage firms and asset managers do not allow investment in crypto including crypto ETFs. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has stated on their website that they do not allow crypto ETFs on their platform because they “do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.” Similarly, Edward Jones released guidance stating that “cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and [they] don’t offer a way to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies” including crypto funds. While Morgan Stanley recently started allowing their financial advisors to offer bitcoin ETFs, there is a significant caveat. They can only offer the two largest funds – Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC – and these can only be offered to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million with aggressive risk tolerance. These are likely the most difficult barriers to overcome because they can’t simply be solved by education, but persistent investor and advisor demand should reduce these barriers over time. Bottom Line: Crypto ETFs have come a long way, and I still believe the industry has room to move forward. But we need to address education to encourage adoption and bridge the gap between advisors and their clients. - Roxanna Islam, CFA, CAIA, Head of Sector & Industry Research, TMX VettaFi  Q. Can advisors help their clients with crypto investments? It can be challenging for financial advisors to meet the needs of clients when it comes to investing in digital assets. The landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, and the learning curve for traditional advisors is steep. From understanding the complexities of the crypto market to managing the risks associated with digital assets, the journey can be overwhelming. Many advisors may not even have the capability to invest in a bitcoin ETF, let alone feel comfortable discussing it with clients. As a result, clients often find themselves navigating the crypto market alone, without the guidance of their trusted financial advisor. Q. How does it impact clients who don’t have advisors help? This disconnect can lead to significant problems for investors. Without proper guidance, clients may invest in the wrong asset at the wrong time, resulting in substantial losses. Improper portfolio weighting toward cryptocurrencies can also expose investors to unnecessary risk, while the potential for fraud in the crypto space remains a constant threat. These pitfalls can create a sense of distrust and uncertainty around digital assets, causing many to wonder whether they should avoid the space altogether. Q. What’s the risk to not learning about crypto? So, as it stands, advisors are not meeting client needs. This will leave clients under-allocated at a time when the asset is still experiencing outperformance relative to traditional assets. The opportunity cost of forgoing significant alpha could significantly impair client performance over the long run. It is crucial for advisors to realize the time is now to position their clients for future success. It’s time for advisors to educate themselves on this asset class and pass on what they learn to clients. Remember, as an advisor, a diversified portfolio does not need a significant allocation to crypto. A 5-10% allocation to bitcoin can go a long way. We are not there yet, but hopefully, the tide is turning. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: Police Arrest Two People Related to $243M Crypto Heist Targeting Genesis Creditor
	author: Oliver Knight

	content: Two people have been arrested following an investigation into a $243 million heist in which the accused thieves allegedly sought to pass thousands of bitcoin through mixing services, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a Thursday statement. On Aug. 19, a creditor of defunct trading firm Genesis fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering scam after being contacted by a spoofed number that posed as a member of Google support, according to information first reported by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT. The victim was convinced to reset their Gemini two-factor authentication settings and send funds to a compromised wallet. Transaction tracing analyzed by ZachXBT shows that the $243 million was split across multiple wallets before being sent to more than 15 exchanges. An unsealed indictment on Thursday identified Malone Lam, 20, a citizen of Singapore who lives in Miami and Los Angeles, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, of Los Angeles, showing both had been arrested Wednesday night and charged with conspiring to steal and launder the cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, according to the Justice Department. A cluster of the stolen funds allegedly flowed into luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. The culprits were tied to the loot after they accidentally shared an address that has been used to purchase luxury clothing. CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security used this information to freeze more than $9 million, with $500,000 being returned to the victim. Both Miami and Los Angeles police departments did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. UPDATE (September 19, 2024, 19:44 UTC): Adds confirmation and indictment information from the U.S. Department of Justice. Edited by Aoyon Ashraf and Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Inside OKX's Strategic Shifts to Its Regulatory Approach, Formula 1 Branding and App Design
	author: Amitoj Singh
	published_at: 09-19-2024 13:11:05
	content: Singapore – Crypto exchange OKX has taken a turn of sorts over the past few months. It is rethinking its strategy in three major areas; the look and tech aspects of its application, its approach toward regulation and expansion, and its brand strategy as the primary partner of McLaren Formula 1 Team, OKX CMO Haider Rafique told CoinDesk in an interview. Rafique revealed the behind the scenes action at OKX in the past year at the unveiling of a limited-edition livery design on the McLaren MCL38 F1 race cars as Singapore gears up for its Grand Prix this weekend. The race stands out in the F1 calendar as it indirectly acts as an advertisement for the region. The fastest cars in the world zip past buildings hosting financial institutions, such as DBS and Standard Chartered, both of whom are involved in the crypto ecosystem. The design, titled Legend Reborn, celebrated the iconic MP4 era of McLaren, from 1981 to 1996, honoring its legends Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Niki Lauda. "When we shopped McLaren, they were team number eight on the grid. A lot of people asked the obvious question, was that the right move? Now leading the 2024 Constructors Standings," said Rafique. McLaren last won the constructors' championship, one of the two world championships contested in Formula 1, in 1998. This year, currently, it is in the lead. "People go there to watch the sport, not to look at a crypto commercial," Rafique said. "We should be a brand less about pushing our logo and services and more about helping people get into F1. That's the better way to win hearts and minds and have better recall on our logo exposure." In terms of the app design Haider said while we had "rebranded two years ago, we hadn't done our product justice as the design was quite behind." Predicting that OKX would be "one of the largest web three technology companies," Haider said the company had been quietly working to redesign the look on its app, bringing in new tech aspects making its Web3 and trading experience from the "very black and white brand visually" to appear as a "deep technology brand." Haider also revealed OKX's shift in its thinking toward regulation by narrowing its focus. "We find ourselves in a really unique place. We have been largely known as an offshore exchange, in terms of market perception given where we started, where we have largest market share. But the facts are that now, actually, if you look at the last 12 to 15 months of our company history, we are now becoming more onshore than perhaps any global exchange our size," Haider said. While OKX did pull out of India after planning to enter the region, it has secured regulatory victories in Australia and Singapore, which in particular took more than four years, part of which was the "most difficult," OKX's CEO revealed earlier. Additionally, OKX has hired teams and is offering their products in Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands and Turkey. Plans are afoot for more regulatory victories where efforts had been made for years, Haider said "The decision was to put all our energy in making sure we get the licenses where we invested the most in, otherwise it's just millions of dollars wasted."

	title: Maximizing Bitcoin per Share: A New Corporate Strategy
	author: James Van Straten
	published_at: 09-19-2024 12:26:23
	content: Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a significant treasury asset for public companies, a trend catalyzed by MicroStrategy's (MSTR) decision to incorporate bitcoin into its corporate treasury in August 2020, resulting in an over 800% increase in its stock value. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, public companies hold approximately 354,316 BTC, about 1.69% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million. This move has inspired a following, with several other companies adopting bitcoin to diversify and protect themselves from inflationary pressures. Notable among these are Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR) and most recently, Cathedra Bitcoin (CBIT). Cathedra Bitcoin, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has made a strategic shift from focusing solely on bitcoin mining to developing and operating data centers. The change comes as the mining industry faces increasing challenges due to the bitcoin halving. The Hashrate index, which tracks bitcoin mining revenue, is at a relatively low 43 (petahash/second) PH/s, with an all-time low of 36 PH/s, causing many public miners to struggle in 2024. Cathedra's goal is now to maximize bitcoin holdings per share by moving away from mining to create a more sustainable cash flow. This pivot allows the company to continuously acquire more bitcoin, focusing on long-term growth in bitcoin holdings rather than costly operational ventures. "Going forward, we will make all capital allocation decisions with the intention of maximizing our shareholders’ per-share bitcoin holdings," the company said. Also active in the bitcoin treasury arena is Metaplanet, led by CEO Simon Gerovich. Similar to Cathedra, Metaplanet is also prioritizing growth in its bitcoin holdings. Gerovich has emphasized the company's goal of boosting its holdings each month, a strategy that has led to significant gains. Year-to-date, Metaplanet's stock value has increased by 587%, reflecting the market's positive response to its strategic approach. MicroStrategy remains a pioneer and the most significant participant in the bitcoin treasury space. Under Michael Saylor's leadership, the company continues to innovate and expand bitcoin adoption. On Sept. 18, it announced the pricing of a $875 million convertible senior notes offering, upsized from an initial $700 million. The notes carry a 0.625% interest rate and mature in 2028. The proceeds will be used to redeem $500 million in high-interest 6.125% senior secured notes at a redemption price of 103.063% of the principal amount, reducing the company's interest payments. The remaining funds will be used to buy more bitcoin. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to buy up to an additional $135 million in notes. In a recent 8-K filing, MicroStrategy introduced an innovative concept called "bitcoin yield," which measures the percentage change in the company's bitcoin holdings relative to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, including both Class A and Class B shares. From January 1 to Sept.12 the company's bitcoin yield was 17%, with a quarter-to-date yield of 4.4%. According to the MSTR-tracker, the bitcoin per share ratio is currently about 0.0012. This metric suggests that long-term shareholders are experiencing accretive value in their bitcoin holdings. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: Solana-Based Drift Raises $25M to Build 'SuperApp' for DeFi Trading
	author: Jamie Crawley
	published_at: 09-19-2024 11:46:00
	content: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange. The round was led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from Blockchain Capital, Folius Ventures, Maelstrom and Primitive, according to a post on X. Drift wrote on X that it would be the "first on-chain platform to offer cross-collateral margin accounts across a DeFi product suite, spanning perpetual derivatives markets, spot markets, borrow-lend markets and prediction markets." As a decentralized platform, Drift differentiates itself from centralized exchanges in that there is no single entity in control of users' funds. Drift's protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and an associated token, DRIFT, which has risen 2.1% in the last 24 hours to just above $0.71. Solana is the closest competitor to Ethereum, which remains comfortably the biggest blockchain for DeFi activity. The funding news was initially reported by Fortune. Co-founder Cindy Leow told the outlet that she wants Drift to become the "Robinhood of crypto," and that the company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year. Leow said she thinks Solana and not Ethereum – currently the dominant blockchain for DeFi in terms total deposits – will ultimately be the best venue for a platform like Drift, because issuers of tokenized assets will "look at the chain that has the highest amount of activity, the highest amount of users, and the most seamless integration."

	content: Aethir, a project for decentralized GPU cloud computing, and Filecoin Foundation are establishing an alliance to provide clients with enterprise-grade solutions to support their businesses with decentralized infrastructure, according to a blog post: "As part of our collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation, Aethir will explore GPU leasing to Filecoin’s storage providers, thus providing Filecoin’s infrastructure network with a reliable and secure source of GPU cloud computing supplies. In parallel to becoming sealing-as-a-service providers, some of Filecoin’s storage providers can borrow GPU capacity from Aethir if they need excess processing power to seal data onto Filecoin’s network... Aethir’s vast network of 43,000+ top-grade GPUs and our premium selection of 3000+ NVIDIA H100s for advanced GPU workloads can provide a highly scalable and trustworthy solution for all Filecoin storage providers needing additional GPU resources." From a press release: "Additionally, Aethir has integrated with Lighthouse, a platform built on Filecoin offering perpetual storage, encryption, custom gateways and multi-chain smart contracts. Aethir plans to upload AI and node-focused data to the Filecoin network, via Lighthouse. By archiving critical data sets such as TensorOpera Fox-1 to the Filecoin network, Aethir is ensuring transparency, accountability and robust audit trails for AI model governance. Moving forward, Aethir plans to expand its use of Filecoin storage solutions to archive chain state data, enhance data management capabilities, and drive the vision of a fully decentralized ecosystem with minimized operational costs." CoinDesk 20 asset: (FIL) Wormhole, a blockchain interoperability project, announced its largest platform overhaul to date, Era3. According to the team, "This entails expanded integrations of intents and NTT, composable intents, a full-service offering for token transfers/cross-chain swap and Wormhole scan, a tool for improving transaction tracking capabilities and analytics. Core to Era3 is the launch of the Wormhole Institutional offering for financial and enterprise use cases, with institutional partners like Securitize and Google Cloud as early adopters." {{W}} Zeta Markets, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on Solana, unveiled Bullet – described as Solana’s first layer-2 solution – along with the latest version of Zeta X, at Solana Breakpoint 2024. According to the team: "Bullet, a zkVM-based L2 rollup, aims to solve issues like block times, latency and network congestion, enhancing Solana's performance. Bullet's testnet will launch in Q4 2024, with the mainnet expected in early 2025. Zeta X, the first super app on Bullet, will offer a CEX-like experience with features such as 100x leverage, near-instant confirmations, and advanced chain abstraction." Telos Foundation, supporting the Telos blockchain, announced the launch of its new crypto exchange, Telos X. According to the team: "Telos X will also act as a key component within the Telos Network, which currently powers hundreds of unique dApps, including NewLife, Zeptagram, Seeds, Wordproof, Appics, Qubicles, Qudo and Taikai." Abra, a platform for digital asset services, has partnered with Praxis, described as "the first network state," to collaborate on real world asset tokenization, as well as DeFi services to network states, including those created on the Praxis platform. According to the team: "Praxis and Abra intend to create an on-chain database of real estate, businesses, citizenship, contracts, marketplaces and other on-chain DeFi (decentralized financial) services that interact seamlessly with both online communities and physical cities." Soulbound, a Web3 social gaming ecosystem, will launch its Web3 live streaming platform at TwitchCon San Diego, starting September 20, 2024. The semi-annual convention organized by Twitch will provide an opportunity for Soulbound to present its platform. Soulbound is backed by investors including Animoca Brands, NGC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings. The platform is designed to offer content monetization, community interactions and enhanced creator and viewer experiences." Blockchain storage layer Xandeum is revealing its blueprint for scaling Solana storage at Breakpoint 2024. According to the team, the project is introducing “Xandeum buckets,” described as "an exabytes+ scalable file system integrated directly into Solana RPC nodes. Storage will be offloaded to a decentralized network of hundreds of thousands of storage provider nodes (pNodes), supervised by Xandeum-enabled Solana validators. PNodes, validators, & liquid stakers will earn additional rewards in SOL, thanks to highly dynamic fee markets designed to optimize storage efficiency and profitability." Worldcoin, the blockchain identity network known for its iris-scanning orbs as well as its affiliation with OpenAI founder Sam Altman, introduced Face Auth, a new security measure for World ID. According to the team: "Face Auth is a private 1:1 face comparison that ensures only the person who verified their World ID at an orb can use it. It provides increased security for your World ID during actions like online purchases, financial transactions, secure sign-in applications and much more." The Polkadot community released its latest major product, Agile Coretime, as part of the ongoing Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. According to the team: "This new feature represents a significant advancement in how computational resources are allocated and managed within the Polkadot ecosystem... This new approach replaces the previous auction system, in which single cores were leased for two years at a time." Accoding to the project documentation: "Agile Coretime allows for the purchase of coretime in 'bulk,' with an allocation for one month. Heavy duty parachains which need to author a block every 12 seconds (or every six seconds through Asynchronous Backing), can seamlessly 'renew' the core each month. Coretime renewal orders take precedence over new orders and provide protection against price fluctuations, allowing parachains to plan their project budget and costs more effectively. The purchased coretime can also be split up and sold in parts, down to a single block per month, allowing for secondary markets to thrive and improve the allocation efficiency of coretime." Core usage before, with Polkadot 1.0: After, with Polkadot 2.0 and Agile Coretime: Privado ID, formerly Polygon ID, which has established proofs-of-concept with several multinational banking and financial service companies, announced a strategic merger with Disco, a pioneer in multichain verifiable data and reputation management. According to the team: "The merger will propel the development and adoption of a unified, chain-agnostic digital identity infrastructure spanning both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, and for the first time see Privado ID become available in chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base and others with Privado ID's own established partnerships and scalable infrastructure." The press release stated: "By leveraging Disco’s Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Privado ID enhances cross-chain compatibility enabling it to expand its services across multiple EVM-compatible chains." Midnight Network, a new layer-1 data protection blockchain, has released its litepaper, “Nightpaper." The paper aims to "demonstrate how the network enables apps that protect user, commercial and transaction metadata. The Nightpaper explains how Midnight has solved a new blockchain trilemma: using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for utility without compromising data protection or ownership." Solana Labs's phone designing subsidiary is slated to ship its second crypto phone in 2025, Solana Mobile announced at the Token 2049 conference on Thursday. Called Seeker, the upcoming handheld will be a major hardware improvement over Solana's first mobile phone, with better battery, a stronger camera and a lighter design than the Saga, said Emmet Hollyer, who runs Solana Labs' phonemaking project. CoinDesk 20 asset: (SOL) Civic, developer of a tokenized identity solution on the verifiable web, has partnered with Rentality, described as the first Web3 car rental platform, "to securely verify drivers' licenses and enforce age minimums on the Base network." According to the team: "Using Civic's ID Verification Pass, users can verify licenses virtually, streamlining the car rental process. This solution enhances security, trust and compliance in car rentals and peer-to-peer marketplaces by eliminating the need for physical verification and reducing friction in the transaction, setting a new standard for secure rentals." Chromia, a blockchain ecosystem that aims to avoid network congestion partly by giving every decentralized app (dapp) its own cluster of nodes and computational resources, announced the upcoming "Asgard" mainnet upgrade on the TOKEN2049 stage, along with a $20 million Data and AI Ecosystem Fund. According to the team: "The fund is aimed at supporting data-intensive projects and AI-enabled applications. Asgard, scheduled for Q4 2024, will introduce 'Extensions' – customized chains designed to bring new functionalities to the platform such as oracles, computation for AI models, support for data availability and ZK proofs." Jade City, a RWA platform specifically designed for tokenization of the $50 billion-plus jade market, released its white paper. According to the team: "The Jade City white paper outlines how the new platform will kick off a new era of RWA tokenization when it launches later in 2024, detailing its supply and value chain, supply and distribution partners, revenue and token model, and ongoing roadmap." According to the white paper: "The economy of Jade City is powered by a community-funded value chain. The Jade City community gains access to raw material by purchasing a treasury bond with a stablecoin such as USDT. These funds are used to acquire jade early in the value chain. In return, part of the profit generated from processing and sales is given back to bond holders in the form of tokenized physical jade. The majority of the remaining profit is used to buy. and burn the $JCT token, channeling value to the token holders." The project was co-founded by the owners of the largest jade deposit, the paper reads. According to a spokesperson, the project is being built on Base, with a beta platform expected in early October. ChainOpera AI, a decentralized and open AI platform, has emerged from stealth, according to the team. The project is "launching its decentralized platform and app marketplace that enables developers to build, train, and deploy AI applications using fully decentralized resources. While existing decentralized AI solutions focus on infrastructure like GPUs, they still rely on centralized providers like AWS. ChainOpera fills this gap by delivering enterprise-grade AI models and decentralized infrastructure, providing cost-effective GPU access, community-sourced AI training, and a marketplace for apps built on its decentralized infrastructure." Oasis Network, designed to be a scalable, privacy-first and versatile layer-1 blockchain, has launched liquid staking in partnership with Accumulated Finance, according to the team: "ROSE token holders can now stake their assets while keeping them liquid for trading or use in DeFi applications. This new feature, powered by the Oasis Sapphire ecosystem, provides stROSE, a liquid staking token, allowing users to earn rewards and engage with decentralized apps. Improvements include boosted staking APR and a reduced unbonding period." Users no longer have a 14-day unbonding period when converting staked ROSE to unstaked ROSE, a blog post reads. MatrixPort, a digital asset services platform, and exSat, a docking layer for Bitcoin scalability, plan to work together to introduce nBTC, a wrapped bitcoin alternative, "to improve liquidity and enable diverse financial applications such as staking and lending," according to the team: MatrixPort "will leverage its technology and user base, while exSat focuses on indexing UTXO data. The strategic partnership is set to position exSat as the biggest among Bitcoin L2s, with ~$400 million at launch." RedStone, a leading provider of blockchain oracles, announced the integration of its data feeds into the TON (The Open Network) blockchain. According to the team: "This integration empowers developers and users with fast, gas-efficient and secure data solutions. It is the first and only oracle solution to offer price feeds for TON. By continually expanding its data feeds to meet the evolving demands of the TON ecosystem and deploying production infrastructure to support high-demand asset prices, RedStone is dedicated to fostering the continued growth of TON’s DeFi landscape." Aethir and GameCentric announced a collaboration to enhance Web3 gaming using Aethir’s decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure. According to the team: "This integration boosts GameCentric’s scalability, security, and performance, supporting its expansion into in-game tokens, non-custodial wallets, and a marketplace. This collaboration enables GameCentric to lead in emerging markets while elevating player experiences across Web2 and Web3." Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange, Fortune reported on Thursday. The round was led by led by Multicoin Capital. Drift plans to build an array of financial services tools, including spot and derivatives trading and a predictions market to become the "Robinhood of crypto," co-founder Cindy Leow said, according to the report. The company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year.

	title: Prediction Markets Go to Washington('s Appeals Court)
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-20-2024 16:00:00
	content: The CFTC is working to ban political prediction markets. Its current goal: Get a federal appeals court to keep one from launching while it argues a judge was mistaken in overturning its rejection of Kalshi. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. It's unclear whether political prediction markets will launch in the U.S. before the election (I'm not counting Kalshi's 8-hour effort last week). The ball's in an appeals court to make a decision one way or another, and a 2.5-hour hearing on Thursday elicited few clues about where the judges may land. While Kalshi's prediction markets aren't directly crypto-related, if Kalshi does win the ability to list and trade political event contracts, it may open the door for other providers to enter – or possibly re-enter – the U.S. market. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the middle of a rulemaking process to ban political prediction markets in the U.S. entirely by formally adding these types of event contracts to the definition of "gaming." That effort took a major blow last week, when District of Columbia District Judge Jia Cobb ruled against the regulator in Kalshi v. CFTC. Some quick background: Kalshi tried to self-certify political prediction markets in 2023, but the CFTC ordered that the company could not list or trade those products. Kalshi sued, and on Sept. 6, the judge ruled that Kalshi won – though she didn't actually publish her opinion explaining the ruling until Sept. 12. The full opinion goes into detail about how the judge assessed the CFTC's definition of "gaming" and "involves" as they pertain to the statute (the Commodity Exchange Act) the regulator used to reject the products. The CFTC filed an emergency stay for appeal hours after Kalshi launched its new contracts, willing at least a temporary halt while the appeals court judges consider the emergency motion. As of the time I'm writing this, the contracts are still halted. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for Thursday, giving each party 15 minutes to make its case – though ultimately it ran for some 2.5 hours. We'll presumably find out if the contracts can restart before the election happens after the hearing, but there's no firm timeline here. And of course, there's still the broader question about the appeal itself and how that may go. The broader picture, of course, is the CFTC's ongoing rulemaking around the role of political prediction markets in the U.S. The CFTC's view is it shouldn't be responsible for overseeing these because it'd be too difficult for the regulator to police the underlying market – i.e. the results of the U.S. elections – for fraud and manipulation. The markets themselves may be subject to manipulation through the use of misleading or false polling data, CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz argued in court Thursday. And manipulation on prediction markets may further undermine confidence in elections themselves. Kalshi's view is these concerns are besides the point, because Congress authorized the CFTC to block certain types of event contracts and election markets aren't on the list. "Their argument comes down to characterizing these event contracts as involving either gaming or unlawful activity," said Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth. "The problem as to both is that the Commission's interpretations of how the statute works and how this link what this language means are so broad that they would sweep all event contracts, thereby rendering the other enumerated activity superfluous and flipping the whole structure of how this statute works. And they have not been able to give a limiting principle." Roth represents Kalshi in its case against the CFTC. Schwartz pointed to the Commodity Exchange Act and its preemption of state laws in his argument, noting that some states have laws banning election wagers. The CEA preempts state law, so allowing Kalshi to list political event contracts may run into conflicts with those laws, in one hypothetical. The judges grilled both attorneys, seemingly unimpressed by either over the course of the 2.5-hour hearing (which was originally set to last 30 minutes). It remains to be seen how they'll rule on the temporary stay.

	title: Consensys Suit Against U.S. SEC Dismissed by Texas Court
	author: Jesse Hamilton
	published_at: 09-20-2024 15:48:21
	content: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had – for a time – added Consensys to a list of crypto investigation targets, prompting the technology incubator company to sue it for overreach in federal court. Because the regulator then shut down that Ethereum probe earlier this year, a Texas judge has decided the lack of immediate danger means the lawsuit is unwarranted. Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted in a Thursday filing that "because withholding consideration subjects plaintiff to scant, if any, hardship, the claim lacks a ripe case or controversy." In other words, since there's no clear future threat to Consensys, there's no point in this judge weighing in. "In a significant win for the industry, the SEC dropped its 'Ethereum 2.0' investigation after our litigation was filed, and the Texas court today recognized that the SEC already gave Consensys the relief it sought on that critical issue for the Ethereum ecosystem," the company said in a post on X. Read More: SEC Ends Probe Into Consensys, Won't Sue Over Ethereum Consensys argued that its lawsuit "laid bare the overzealous investigation of Ethereum, and policymakers and the public at large voiced deep concern over the SEC’s investigation of blockchain software development." A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the case being dismissed. When Consensys sued the agency in April, it asked the court to declare that Ethereum's ether (ETH) is not a security and that any investigation of ConsenSys based on the idea that the token is a security would trample on the company's rights. It also contended that MetaMask is not a broker under federal law and that its staking service doesn't violate securities law. After backing down in the ETH investigation, the SEC did follow up with charges against Consensys later in June, alleging that the company's MetaMask service was acting as an unregistered securities broker. While the SEC hasn't made a public statement about ETH's status, last week, the regulator settled charges with eToro which let the trading platform continue listing ETH in the U.S. UPDATE (September 20, 2022, 18:16 UTC): Adds decline to comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	title: MicroStrategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings With $458M Purchase, Upsized Convertible Note Offering to $1B
	author: Krisztian  Sandor
	published_at: 09-20-2024 14:19:49
	content: Nasdaq-listed software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Friday that it purchased 7,420 bitcoin (BTC) for about $458.2 million using the proceeds of its debt offering. The acquisition happened between Sept. 13 and 19 at an average BTC price of approximately $61,750. The company increased its convertible note issuance that concluded Thursday to $1.01 billion from the $700 million principal offering announced earlier this week, according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's bitcoin yield, a novel metric that measures the percentage change in the company's BTC holdings relative to its assumed fully diluted shares outstanding, increased to 5.1% for this quarter, up from 4.4% on September 13, company filings show. The company, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has been a pioneer for bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset, and has become the largest corporate holder of BTC since it started buying in 2020. With the latest purchase, the firm now holds 252,220 bitcoin worth nearly $16 billion at current prices, acquiring at an average BTC price of $39,266 for a total cost of $9.9 billion. The firm still has some $889 million left from its $2 billion ATM equity issuance to acquire more BTC, per last week's regulatory filing. MicroStrategy's shares were down 1.5% from Thursday's market closing price, with U.S. equity indices and BTC also sliding lower. Other public companies such as Semler Scientific, miner Marathon Digital and Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet recently have followed MicroStrategy's footprints to issue debt to accumulate BTC.

	content: The YouTube channel of India’s Supreme Court was compromised on Friday in a first such incident for the judicial body. The channel, which otherwise streams court cases for viewers and the press, showed videos promoting XRP tokens. Its name was changed to “Ripple.live24.” A blank video titled "Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple Responds To The SEC's $2 Billion Fine! XRP PRICE PREDICTION" went live on the channel in the European morning hours. The video and the channel were taken down shortly afterward. “This is to inform all concerned that the YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India has been taken down. The services on YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India will be resumed shortly,” the Supreme Court said in a statement shared with local media companies. The compromise came ahead of several crucial cases scheduled for Friday, the Times of India reported. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

	title: Jump's 'Frankendancer' Validator Client Is Live on Solana Mainnet
	author: Danny Nelson
	published_at: 09-20-2024 07:50:25
	content: SINGAPORE — An early version of Jump Crypto's highly anticipated Solana validator, Firedancer, is live and contributing to the performance of the Solana blockchain, Jump's Chief Science Officer Kevin Bowers said Friday. Speaking onstage at Solana's Breakpoint conference, Bowers shed light on an "open secret" in Solana's validator community: Some of the computing power underpinning Solana is running "Frankendancer" software that combines predominant validator tech with new contributions from Jump. Blockchain validators ingest transactions and construct blocks – the most essential process in running a blockchain. Most networks have a single validator client. Solana's plan to have two fully independent validators – one from a Solana spinoff team, Anza, one from Jump – would give it a redundancy boost, and potentially a performance edge, too. Such behind-the-scenes and in-the-weeds tech developments might seem like a yawner, but at Breakpoint it received top billing. The sellout conference's largest stage was standing room only as Bowers emerged to a rockstar-like atmosphere. "We view this project as the consumer science equivalent of civil engineering," Bowers said of the effort to build the second validator client. He compared the potential impact of Firedancer as akin to expanding a country road into an interstate highway. Bowers shed little light on when Firedancer – the fully new client software, as opposed to Frankendancer – would come online. But it is running on testnet, Bowers said, indicating it has achieved minimum viability and is getting close. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: SocGen's Crypto Unit Takes Euro Stablecoin to Solana After Flopping on Ethereum
	author: Danny Nelson
	published_at: 09-20-2024 07:00:00
	content: SINGAPORE – SG Forge, a subsidiary of Societe Generale, will roll out euro stablecoin EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on the Solana blockchain, the French financial services firm said Friday. SG Forge launched EURCV on the Ethereum blockchain last year as a highly regulated, euro-centric alternative to top dollar-linked stablecoins from Tether and Circle. It has struggled to catch on: EURCV has only 28 holders, 154 lifetime transactions and an issuance of 33 million, according to its Etherscan page. The Solana debut will test whether crypto users have any appetite for Euro-linked stablecoins on a faster and cheaper network, two attributes SG Forge touted in a press release. CEO Jean-Marc Stenger said in the presser that Solana's speed "will unlock new possibilities for both retail users and institutional players in" decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are becoming systemically important to the global financial economy, Bernstein wrote in a recent report. Myriad firms are eager to replicate the success of Circle and Tether, the largest stablecoin issuers who collect major windfalls from ownership of the Treasury notes underlying their respective assets.

	title: Crypto Exchange BingX Hacked, Onchain Data Shows Over $43M Drained
	author: Sam Reynolds
	published_at: 09-20-2024 05:47:45
	content: Crypto exchange BingX has been hacked for a "minor" amount of assets and the exchange plans to compensate users for any loss, the firm's chief product officer (CPO) said in a message on X. On-chain data suggests nearly $43 million was stolen from the exchange in multiple tranches, with $13.25 million ether, $2.3 million BNB, $4.4 million USDT, among other being drained. The first hack was for approximately $26 million, while a few hours afterward, hackers took an additional $16.5 million from the exchange. "The total loss is minimal and manageable. This incident will not affect our ongoing business operations," BingX CPO Vivien Lien said on X. "Trading services continue as usual. Withdrawals and deposits are temporarily delayed and are expected to be restored within 24 hours at the latest." Aside from stablecoins, hackers took more than 360 different types of altcoins. Data from Etherscan shows most of the stolen crypto was swapped for ETH and BNB at DEXs like Uniswap and Kyberswap. As of press time the wallet tied to the hack, which Etherscan says received most of its funds from the BingX hot wallet, has over 1,000 ether in it and tokens worth $5 million.

	title: Crypto Investment Firm Deus X Capital Unveils DeFi Unit Which Will Start New Yield Generating Protocol
	author: Will Canny
	published_at: 09-20-2024 00:00:00
	content: Deus X Capital, the $1 billion investment and operating company led by Tim Grant, today launched Solstice Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) business, the company said in a press release on Friday. Solstice Labs is building institutional-grade DeFi products and protocols that will be available to all investors, the company said. The business' first project is a protocol that offers enhanced yield opportunities, and is expected to go live in early 2025, Deus X said. It aims to deliver stable and consistent yields for investors, Ben Nadareski, co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview, and in a democratized fashion, as all users will have the same access to this yield generating opportunity on the Solstice protocol. The protocol will be developed on the Solana blockchain, and is expected to launch with more than $100 million of total value locked (TVL), with significant investment from Deus X Capital. Nadareski, who is currently an investment director at Deus X Capital, is co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs. Tim Grant, CEO of Deus X Capital will be co-founder and chairman of the company. Stuart Connolly, chief investment officer at Deus X and CEO of Alpha Lab 40, is to join the firm as chief investment officer and co-founder. "Many DeFi products and protocols have been built using exceptional technology stacks like we have seen with Solana but have largely been overlooked for institutional applications," said Nadareski, in the release. "This presents a huge opportunity to introduce institutional-grade yield-opportunities and infrastructure into DeFi which will allow for a far broader range of investment participation," he added. Solstice Labs will work closely with Cor Prime, a prime broker, and Alpha Lab 40, a proprietary trading firm, both of which are portfolio companies of Deus X Capital. Cor Prime launched on Wednesday with a $100 million commitment of risk capital from Deus X Capital, and the company plans to address the supply/demand imbalance for leverage in the crypto market. Deus X Capital launched in October last year with $1 billion of assets, including existing investments and capital to be deployed.

	title: U.S. Election Betting: CFTC, Kalshi Both Grilled by Judges in Appeals Court
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-19-2024 22:06:11
	content: A panel of judges grilled attorneys for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and prediction-betting platform Kalshi over the company's efforts to launch political prediction markets in the U.S., without indicating whether they'd allow Kalshi to offer these products while reviewing a lower court's ruling on the products. CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz and Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth took turns explaining why an appeals court should or should not block Kalshi from listing these events contracts. The Thursday hearing came days after a federal judge ruled that the CFTC could not block Kalshi from listing political prediction markets, letting the company list contracts predicting how control of the House and Senate might play out. But it only lasted for a few hours, since the CFTC quickly filed for an emergency stay, which the appeals court granted on a temporary basis. During the 2.5-hour hearing, the judges did not seem especially impressed by either party, saying various arguments or explanations did not make sense and drilling into specific terms of the Commodity Exchange Act and what they mean. The judges did not get to asking what an event contract actually is until more than two hours into the hearing. The CFTC's Schwartz called D.C. District Court Judge Jia Cobb's Sept. 12 ruling "seriously flawed," and said it could allow Kalshi – and other companies – to immediately launch "high-stakes" betting markets. "If that happens, the harm to the public is going to be profound at a time, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but Americans broadly believe that our democracy is under threat," Schwartz said. "In order to obtain a stay, the commission has to show two things: merit, and that there will be some harm, irreparable harm, absent the stay, and they can't make either of those," Roth said in his opening statement. Kalshi saw $50,000 deposited in its two political events contracts in the eight hours or so that the products were live before the CFTC filed for an emergency stay, Roth said. The CFTC's arguments revolve around the agency's stated inability to police the underlying events – namely, U.S. elections. Market participants could distort markets to suggest one candidate is doing better than another, Schwartz said, and it would be more difficult to correct than other markets. A judge posed the hypothetical question of whether a counterparty might take the other side of a bet made for manipulative purposes: "Somebody will take the other side and eat their lunch. Is that what's supposed to happen?" That is what should happen, but political prediction markets may be susceptible to manipulation that cannot be easily corrected, Schwartz said. "It's because the sources of information that they absorb and reflect are opaque and unreliable. I am talking about polls with undisclosed methodologies, so, bad methodologies, fake polls, pollsters with agendas, inaccurate news, fake news, on and on," he said. "Normal futures contracts have an objective indicator that is reliable, kind of a published index report." If these markets are manipulated, that would both harm the market participants and could even undermine election integrity, Schwartz said. Later in the hearing, he drew a distinction between political event contracts and other types of bets that could be placed. "There's really very little monkeying around you can do with an earthquake," Schwartz said, responding to one example. Roth, speaking on Kalshi's behalf, pushed back, saying the more robust a market is, the less susceptible it would be to that type of manipulation. He pointed to the $1 billion already bet on Polymarket, which does not offer services in the U.S. after a settlement with the CFTC, saying the regulator's argument essentially suggests having an overseas vendor provide these products may be better than Kalshi doing so. "The most important thing I want to make is that the way to reduce that risk is to allow Kalshi markets to offer because right now, this activity is happening and being reported to voters based on markets that are not regulated, that are open to foreign traders, that have no surveillance. … There's no transparency," he said. "We don't know who's buying, who's selling cryptocurrency. If this was happening on Kalshi's markets, we would have this whole suite of regulatory provisions that apply." The CFTC needed to show there was a risk of "irreparable harm" in allowing Kalshi to continue listing and trading its events contracts. Todd Phillips, an assistant professor of law at the Georgia State University Robinson College of Business, told CoinDesk it was "unclear if [the CFTC] did that" over the course of the hearing. The regulator could have done a better job explaining what event contracts actually are and how a state prohibiting gambling on elections counts as gaming for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act, he said. On the other hand, Kalshi also faced tough questioning from the panel of judges on the appeals court. "Kalshi is making an argument that 'you should allow us to do something that 29 states prohibit, and that's big," he said. "That would be effectively overturning the law in more than half the country. Marc Hochstein contributed reporting. Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: German Government Shuts Down 47 Exchanges, Says They're Tied To ‘Illegal Activity’
	author: Helene Braun
	published_at: 09-19-2024 20:46:21
	content: The German Attorney General's Office Frankfurt am Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) and the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) have shut down 47 crypto exchanges allegedly tied to criminal activities including money laundering. The exchanges purposefully failed to comply with their obligation to carry out certain identity and background checks on their customers, also known as “know your customer” (KYC) requirements, the BKA said in a press release on Thursday. Some of the exchanges include Xchange.cash, 60cek.org, Baksman.com, alongside other smaller platforms. One of the exchanges had been active since 2012 while others had launched as recently as the previous year. Some customer and transaction data was seized by the government in the process of the investigation, it said. Given that the people behind those activities often reside in other countries outside of Germany, where criminal activities like this are “tolerated or even protected,” the authorities noted it may be nearly impossible for German government officials to prosecute them. Instead, they will focus on “weakening” the underlying infrastructure that allowed for those illegal activities, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the BKA seized 49,857 bitcoin (BTC), worth $2.1 billion at the time, from the operators of a privacy website called Movie2k.to, which was shut down in 2013 for violating the Copyright Act. The agency proceeded to sell the tokens in July, causing distress in the global crypto markets due to the selling pressure resulting from the dump as well as the simultaneous repayments by defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which happened around the same time. Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Does SBF’s Appeal Stand a Chance of Succeeding?
	author: Ben Schiller
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:34:23
	content: It’s been about 10 months since Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. It’s been about six months since he was sentenced (in March) to 25 years in federal prison. In that time, the crypto industry has moved on: markets are up, VC dollars are back, and politicians are once again supporting the industry. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has almost forgotten about the fallen crypto king, SBF himself.  So might a judge and jury see SBF’s case differently should it hear evidence from the FTX founder again? That certainly seems to be the hope of SBF’s new legal team, which took over his case after his trial lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, stepped down following his conviction. On Friday, Sept. 13, his new lead lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, laying out why SBF believes he deserves another hearing. “In the United States, people accused of crimes are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” Shapiro's appeal begins. “They are entitled to a fair trial by a jury. When the government introduces evidence, defendants have the right to rebut that evidence and present their side of the story. That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work. But none of that happened here.” The 102-page document argues that SBF was unfairly treated at trial, which took place as public scrutiny of the FTX case reached a fever pitch. Shapiro argues SBF was “presumed guilty by federal prosecutors eager for quick headlines,” “presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial,” and that the “prevailing narrative” of FTX’s collapse, and SBF’s part in it, was accepted as true, without proper inquiry. “From day one, the prevailing narrative—initially spun by the lawyers who took over FTX, quickly adopted by their contacts at the U.S. Attorney’s Office—was that Bankman-Fried had stolen billions of dollars of customer funds, driven FTX to insolvency, and caused billions in losses,” the appeal continues. “Now, nearly two years later, a very different picture is emerging—one confirming FTX was never insolvent, and in fact had assets worth billions to repay its customers. But the jury at BankmanFried’s trial never got to see that picture.” SBF has long maintained that FTX was never really insolvent and it was forced into bankruptcy unnecessarily. It notes that, under the bankruptcy settlement, nearly all its customers are being made whole. Shapiro says Judge Lewis A. Kaplan deprived the jury of “Brady” evidence favorable to the defendant, including that SBF made good investments (such as in Anthropic, the AI startup) alongside the bad ones. However, lawyers contacted by CoinDesk were skeptical that SBF would win a retrial, given the high bar for such legal turnovers. “It’s just not very common for an appellate court to double-guess a case like this,” said Tama Beth Kudman, partner at Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner. SBF’s lawyers would have to prove not only that Kaplan was biased against SBF, she said, and also that such bias led to actions that were prejudicial against SBF. To allow the appeal to go forward, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would be saying effectively that it thought the judge in the original case acted inappropriately – something it rarely does, Kudman said. The appeals court might order a retrial if SBF's lawyers could show that Kaplan had a personal conflict of interest. But there’s no evidence for that, thus far. “Kaplan is known as a well-tempered, good natured judge. I would have thought he would have stepped aside if there was any reason that he shouldn’t be hearing the case,” Kudman said. Joshua Ashley Klayman, the U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters, said the appeal may have been timed to coincide with sentencing for Caroline Ellison, SBF’s former colleague and sometime lover. U.S. government lawyers have not requested jail time for Ellison, noting that the SBF case would have been “difficult to prove” without her testimony. Shapiro may be trying to juxtapose SBF’s steep sentencing with Ellison’s much lighter penalty. “Without expressing a view on the likelihood of success of Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal, the timing of his filing may be strategic," Klayman said. "SBF’s appeal was filed on September 13, 2024, three days after the filing of Caroline Ellison’s sentencing memorandum. SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison’s counsel has requested a non-custodial sentence." Klayman said news that FTX creditors are being repaid could help SBF's legal team. “The mainstream media has reported on FTX’s plans to repay customers. Perhaps SBF and his counsel may hope that, with the passage of time, SBF’s arguments [that FTX customers didn’t lose money] may be viewed in a different light." Joe Valenti, partner in the White Collar & Government Enforcement practice at law firm Saul Ewing, says appeals courts tend to give significant discretion to judges in weighing evidence, provided they meet a basic standard of reasonableness. "Anything that's tied to the reading of the facts, or the conduct of the courtroom, they give significant leeway to the court," he said. Judges are allowed to control the courtroom in the interest of expeditious justice and limiting evidence from being admitted to the record is well within the discretion of the judge. As for the argument that customers are being made whole in bankruptcy, Valenti doesn't see that argument holding much water either. "It doesn't matter if the money was paid back. If you're a cashier at the supermarket and you take $20 to go to the casino, it doesn’t matter if you give back the money the next day. You still took money from the grocery store."

	title: Ethereum Developers Confirm Plan to Split 'Pectra' Upgrade In Two
	author: Margaux Nijkerk
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:15:58
	content: Ethereum developers agreed on Thursday to split their upcoming hard fork, Pectra, into two packages, in a move to make the massive upgrade less unwieldy and reduce the risk of missteps or bugs. The decision to split up the upgrade wasn't unexpected. Developers had discussed previously that Pectra was becoming too ambitious to ship all at once, floating the idea of splitting it up in order to minimize the risk of finding bugs in the code. Pectra was on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork is the technical term for when a blockchain splits from its original, and is the method used by Ethereum to implement major software upgrades.) Now, developers will be able to focus on a much narrower scope. Previously, developers shared they would aim to have the upgrade live in early 2025; that is still the case for the first part of the Pectra package. The core developers decided that eight Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) will be included in the first package, which includes EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets, and famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes. The second package is up to be changed over the next few months, but as of now could include proposals that aim to make changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, known as EOF, along with introducing a feature called PeerDAS, which improves data availability sampling and ultimately is beneficial for layer-2 blockchains. The developers acknowledged that the scopes of these upgrades can change over time, so solidifying this upgrade wouldn't be wise in this moment. "There seems to be agreements to split current Pectra somehow," said Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes, who led the call. "And then downstream, we can figure out what comes next." “I hear everyone that, it can be tricky to not want to put new things in. I would lean towards, again, keeping the scope very small, just because then that's going to maximize our chances of actually shipping the second fork very quickly with respect to this first one,” Stokes added.

This is Crypto for Advisors, after all, so in today’s issue, Roxanna Islam from TMX VettaFi takes us through crypto demand and adoption since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. In Ask an Expert, Bryan Courchesne, CEO of DAIM, looks at whether advisors are supporting their clients investments in crypto and, if not, where the risks lie. – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Many of us thought that the launch of spot crypto ETFs would help bring crypto into the mainstream and encourage adoption - particularly by closing the gap between advisors and their clients. While the spot bitcoin ETF launch in January broke records, demand for spot Ethereum ETFs has been muted. And now with no near-term approval for Solana ETFs, this raises the question – does interest in crypto ETFs end with bitcoin? I believe there will be more to the crypto ETF story, but there are three big questions we need to answer about demand. 1. Are clients ACTUALLY interested in crypto? Seasoned crypto investors see the benefit of investing directly in cryptocurrencies – not just bitcoin. However, crypto ETFs brought access to other groups of investors, including retail investors who are newer to crypto and more comfortable with a traditional vehicle like an ETF. And unlike the old-school crypto investor, newer investors may be satisfied with a simpler approach to cryptocurrency investing (i.e., investing in just bitcoin ETFs). Despite the fact that bitcoin and ether (symbol ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) have two very different use cases, it is very easy to use bitcoin as a “just for fun” investment without fully diversifying their crypto allocation. This has been reflected in net flows for crypto launches. Excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $37.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January, with net inflows for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bringing in $20.9 billion of those flows. Since their launch in July, spot ether ETFs have seen net inflows of only $2.1 billion (excluding the flagship Grayscale product). The highest inflows were seen in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which had only $1.0 billion net inflows – a significant gap from its spot bitcoin counterpart. While I believe interest in spot Ether will grow over time, these trends indicate that mainstream investors still haven’t fully embraced crypto. 2. Are advisors WILLING to allocate to crypto? Given a niche portion of clients interested in crypto ETFs, the next step is making sure advisors are also open to conversation. The survey results shown below are important because 64% of advisors surveyed—that’s almost two-thirds of advisors—are neutral to negative on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bloomberg Terminal data show that the majority of investors who own spot crypto products are self-directed investors—not those who invest through an advisor. According to this data, 80% of shares held of iShares’ (IBIT) and 75% of shares held of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) are by investors who do not file 13Fs (i.e., self-directed clients). Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to getting advisors more interested in this asset class. Education – not just for investors, but also focused on advisors – will be the primary solution. Education takes time but should become easier as time passes and ease acceptance among both clients and advisors. 3. CAN advisors allocate to crypto? Assuming both clients and advisors are interested, there are still some barriers to investing. Many large brokerage firms and asset managers do not allow investment in crypto including crypto ETFs. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has stated on their website that they do not allow crypto ETFs on their platform because they “do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.” Similarly, Edward Jones released guidance stating that “cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and [they] don’t offer a way to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies” including crypto funds. While Morgan Stanley recently started allowing their financial advisors to offer bitcoin ETFs, there is a significant caveat. They can only offer the two largest funds – Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC – and these can only be offered to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million with aggressive risk tolerance. These are likely the most difficult barriers to overcome because they can’t simply be solved by education, but persistent investor and advisor demand should reduce these barriers over time. Bottom Line: Crypto ETFs have come a long way, and I still believe the industry has room to move forward. But we need to address education to encourage adoption and bridge the gap between advisors and their clients. - Roxanna Islam, CFA, CAIA, Head of Sector & Industry Research, TMX VettaFi  Q. Can advisors help their clients with crypto investments? It can be challenging for financial advisors to meet the needs of clients when it comes to investing in digital assets. The landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, and the learning curve for traditional advisors is steep. From understanding the complexities of the crypto market to managing the risks associated with digital assets, the journey can be overwhelming. Many advisors may not even have the capability to invest in a bitcoin ETF, let alone feel comfortable discussing it with clients. As a result, clients often find themselves navigating the crypto market alone, without the guidance of their trusted financial advisor. Q. How does it impact clients who don’t have advisors help? This disconnect can lead to significant problems for investors. Without proper guidance, clients may invest in the wrong asset at the wrong time, resulting in substantial losses. Improper portfolio weighting toward cryptocurrencies can also expose investors to unnecessary risk, while the potential for fraud in the crypto space remains a constant threat. These pitfalls can create a sense of distrust and uncertainty around digital assets, causing many to wonder whether they should avoid the space altogether. Q. What’s the risk to not learning about crypto? So, as it stands, advisors are not meeting client needs. This will leave clients under-allocated at a time when the asset is still experiencing outperformance relative to traditional assets. The opportunity cost of forgoing significant alpha could significantly impair client performance over the long run. It is crucial for advisors to realize the time is now to position their clients for future success. It’s time for advisors to educate themselves on this asset class and pass on what they learn to clients. Remember, as an advisor, a diversified portfolio does not need a significant allocation to crypto. A 5-10% allocation to bitcoin can go a long way. We are not there yet, but hopefully, the tide is turning. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: Police Arrest Two People Related to $243M Crypto Heist Targeting Genesis Creditor
	author: Oliver Knight

	content: Two people have been arrested following an investigation into a $243 million heist in which the accused thieves allegedly sought to pass thousands of bitcoin through mixing services, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a Thursday statement. On Aug. 19, a creditor of defunct trading firm Genesis fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering scam after being contacted by a spoofed number that posed as a member of Google support, according to information first reported by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT. The victim was convinced to reset their Gemini two-factor authentication settings and send funds to a compromised wallet. Transaction tracing analyzed by ZachXBT shows that the $243 million was split across multiple wallets before being sent to more than 15 exchanges. An unsealed indictment on Thursday identified Malone Lam, 20, a citizen of Singapore who lives in Miami and Los Angeles, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, of Los Angeles, showing both had been arrested Wednesday night and charged with conspiring to steal and launder the cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, according to the Justice Department. A cluster of the stolen funds allegedly flowed into luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. The culprits were tied to the loot after they accidentally shared an address that has been used to purchase luxury clothing. CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security used this information to freeze more than $9 million, with $500,000 being returned to the victim. Both Miami and Los Angeles police departments did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. UPDATE (September 19, 2024, 19:44 UTC): Adds confirmation and indictment information from the U.S. Department of Justice. Edited by Aoyon Ashraf and Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Inside OKX's Strategic Shifts to Its Regulatory Approach, Formula 1 Branding and App Design
	author: Amitoj Singh
	published_at: 09-19-2024 13:11:05
	content: Singapore – Crypto exchange OKX has taken a turn of sorts over the past few months. It is rethinking its strategy in three major areas; the look and tech aspects of its application, its approach toward regulation and expansion, and its brand strategy as the primary partner of McLaren Formula 1 Team, OKX CMO Haider Rafique told CoinDesk in an interview. Rafique revealed the behind the scenes action at OKX in the past year at the unveiling of a limited-edition livery design on the McLaren MCL38 F1 race cars as Singapore gears up for its Grand Prix this weekend. The race stands out in the F1 calendar as it indirectly acts as an advertisement for the region. The fastest cars in the world zip past buildings hosting financial institutions, such as DBS and Standard Chartered, both of whom are involved in the crypto ecosystem. The design, titled Legend Reborn, celebrated the iconic MP4 era of McLaren, from 1981 to 1996, honoring its legends Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Niki Lauda. "When we shopped McLaren, they were team number eight on the grid. A lot of people asked the obvious question, was that the right move? Now leading the 2024 Constructors Standings," said Rafique. McLaren last won the constructors' championship, one of the two world championships contested in Formula 1, in 1998. This year, currently, it is in the lead. "People go there to watch the sport, not to look at a crypto commercial," Rafique said. "We should be a brand less about pushing our logo and services and more about helping people get into F1. That's the better way to win hearts and minds and have better recall on our logo exposure." In terms of the app design Haider said while we had "rebranded two years ago, we hadn't done our product justice as the design was quite behind." Predicting that OKX would be "one of the largest web three technology companies," Haider said the company had been quietly working to redesign the look on its app, bringing in new tech aspects making its Web3 and trading experience from the "very black and white brand visually" to appear as a "deep technology brand." Haider also revealed OKX's shift in its thinking toward regulation by narrowing its focus. "We find ourselves in a really unique place. We have been largely known as an offshore exchange, in terms of market perception given where we started, where we have largest market share. But the facts are that now, actually, if you look at the last 12 to 15 months of our company history, we are now becoming more onshore than perhaps any global exchange our size," Haider said. While OKX did pull out of India after planning to enter the region, it has secured regulatory victories in Australia and Singapore, which in particular took more than four years, part of which was the "most difficult," OKX's CEO revealed earlier. Additionally, OKX has hired teams and is offering their products in Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands and Turkey. Plans are afoot for more regulatory victories where efforts had been made for years, Haider said "The decision was to put all our energy in making sure we get the licenses where we invested the most in, otherwise it's just millions of dollars wasted."

	title: Maximizing Bitcoin per Share: A New Corporate Strategy
	author: James Van Straten
	published_at: 09-19-2024 12:26:23
	content: Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a significant treasury asset for public companies, a trend catalyzed by MicroStrategy's (MSTR) decision to incorporate bitcoin into its corporate treasury in August 2020, resulting in an over 800% increase in its stock value. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, public companies hold approximately 354,316 BTC, about 1.69% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million. This move has inspired a following, with several other companies adopting bitcoin to diversify and protect themselves from inflationary pressures. Notable among these are Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR) and most recently, Cathedra Bitcoin (CBIT). Cathedra Bitcoin, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has made a strategic shift from focusing solely on bitcoin mining to developing and operating data centers. The change comes as the mining industry faces increasing challenges due to the bitcoin halving. The Hashrate index, which tracks bitcoin mining revenue, is at a relatively low 43 (petahash/second) PH/s, with an all-time low of 36 PH/s, causing many public miners to struggle in 2024. Cathedra's goal is now to maximize bitcoin holdings per share by moving away from mining to create a more sustainable cash flow. This pivot allows the company to continuously acquire more bitcoin, focusing on long-term growth in bitcoin holdings rather than costly operational ventures. "Going forward, we will make all capital allocation decisions with the intention of maximizing our shareholders’ per-share bitcoin holdings," the company said. Also active in the bitcoin treasury arena is Metaplanet, led by CEO Simon Gerovich. Similar to Cathedra, Metaplanet is also prioritizing growth in its bitcoin holdings. Gerovich has emphasized the company's goal of boosting its holdings each month, a strategy that has led to significant gains. Year-to-date, Metaplanet's stock value has increased by 587%, reflecting the market's positive response to its strategic approach. MicroStrategy remains a pioneer and the most significant participant in the bitcoin treasury space. Under Michael Saylor's leadership, the company continues to innovate and expand bitcoin adoption. On Sept. 18, it announced the pricing of a $875 million convertible senior notes offering, upsized from an initial $700 million. The notes carry a 0.625% interest rate and mature in 2028. The proceeds will be used to redeem $500 million in high-interest 6.125% senior secured notes at a redemption price of 103.063% of the principal amount, reducing the company's interest payments. The remaining funds will be used to buy more bitcoin. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to buy up to an additional $135 million in notes. In a recent 8-K filing, MicroStrategy introduced an innovative concept called "bitcoin yield," which measures the percentage change in the company's bitcoin holdings relative to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, including both Class A and Class B shares. From January 1 to Sept.12 the company's bitcoin yield was 17%, with a quarter-to-date yield of 4.4%. According to the MSTR-tracker, the bitcoin per share ratio is currently about 0.0012. This metric suggests that long-term shareholders are experiencing accretive value in their bitcoin holdings. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: Solana-Based Drift Raises $25M to Build 'SuperApp' for DeFi Trading
	author: Jamie Crawley
	published_at: 09-19-2024 11:46:00
	content: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange. The round was led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from Blockchain Capital, Folius Ventures, Maelstrom and Primitive, according to a post on X. Drift wrote on X that it would be the "first on-chain platform to offer cross-collateral margin accounts across a DeFi product suite, spanning perpetual derivatives markets, spot markets, borrow-lend markets and prediction markets." As a decentralized platform, Drift differentiates itself from centralized exchanges in that there is no single entity in control of users' funds. Drift's protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and an associated token, DRIFT, which has risen 2.1% in the last 24 hours to just above $0.71. Solana is the closest competitor to Ethereum, which remains comfortably the biggest blockchain for DeFi activity. The funding news was initially reported by Fortune. Co-founder Cindy Leow told the outlet that she wants Drift to become the "Robinhood of crypto," and that the company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year. Leow said she thinks Solana and not Ethereum – currently the dominant blockchain for DeFi in terms total deposits – will ultimately be the best venue for a platform like Drift, because issuers of tokenized assets will "look at the chain that has the highest amount of activity, the highest amount of users, and the most seamless integration."

	content: Aethir, a project for decentralized GPU cloud computing, and Filecoin Foundation are establishing an alliance to provide clients with enterprise-grade solutions to support their businesses with decentralized infrastructure, according to a blog post: "As part of our collaboration with the Filecoin Foundation, Aethir will explore GPU leasing to Filecoin’s storage providers, thus providing Filecoin’s infrastructure network with a reliable and secure source of GPU cloud computing supplies. In parallel to becoming sealing-as-a-service providers, some of Filecoin’s storage providers can borrow GPU capacity from Aethir if they need excess processing power to seal data onto Filecoin’s network... Aethir’s vast network of 43,000+ top-grade GPUs and our premium selection of 3000+ NVIDIA H100s for advanced GPU workloads can provide a highly scalable and trustworthy solution for all Filecoin storage providers needing additional GPU resources." From a press release: "Additionally, Aethir has integrated with Lighthouse, a platform built on Filecoin offering perpetual storage, encryption, custom gateways and multi-chain smart contracts. Aethir plans to upload AI and node-focused data to the Filecoin network, via Lighthouse. By archiving critical data sets such as TensorOpera Fox-1 to the Filecoin network, Aethir is ensuring transparency, accountability and robust audit trails for AI model governance. Moving forward, Aethir plans to expand its use of Filecoin storage solutions to archive chain state data, enhance data management capabilities, and drive the vision of a fully decentralized ecosystem with minimized operational costs." CoinDesk 20 asset: (FIL) Wormhole, a blockchain interoperability project, announced its largest platform overhaul to date, Era3. According to the team, "This entails expanded integrations of intents and NTT, composable intents, a full-service offering for token transfers/cross-chain swap and Wormhole scan, a tool for improving transaction tracking capabilities and analytics. Core to Era3 is the launch of the Wormhole Institutional offering for financial and enterprise use cases, with institutional partners like Securitize and Google Cloud as early adopters." {{W}} Zeta Markets, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on Solana, unveiled Bullet – described as Solana’s first layer-2 solution – along with the latest version of Zeta X, at Solana Breakpoint 2024. According to the team: "Bullet, a zkVM-based L2 rollup, aims to solve issues like block times, latency and network congestion, enhancing Solana's performance. Bullet's testnet will launch in Q4 2024, with the mainnet expected in early 2025. Zeta X, the first super app on Bullet, will offer a CEX-like experience with features such as 100x leverage, near-instant confirmations, and advanced chain abstraction." Telos Foundation, supporting the Telos blockchain, announced the launch of its new crypto exchange, Telos X. According to the team: "Telos X will also act as a key component within the Telos Network, which currently powers hundreds of unique dApps, including NewLife, Zeptagram, Seeds, Wordproof, Appics, Qubicles, Qudo and Taikai." Abra, a platform for digital asset services, has partnered with Praxis, described as "the first network state," to collaborate on real world asset tokenization, as well as DeFi services to network states, including those created on the Praxis platform. According to the team: "Praxis and Abra intend to create an on-chain database of real estate, businesses, citizenship, contracts, marketplaces and other on-chain DeFi (decentralized financial) services that interact seamlessly with both online communities and physical cities." Soulbound, a Web3 social gaming ecosystem, will launch its Web3 live streaming platform at TwitchCon San Diego, starting September 20, 2024. The semi-annual convention organized by Twitch will provide an opportunity for Soulbound to present its platform. Soulbound is backed by investors including Animoca Brands, NGC Ventures and Big Brain Holdings. The platform is designed to offer content monetization, community interactions and enhanced creator and viewer experiences." Blockchain storage layer Xandeum is revealing its blueprint for scaling Solana storage at Breakpoint 2024. According to the team, the project is introducing “Xandeum buckets,” described as "an exabytes+ scalable file system integrated directly into Solana RPC nodes. Storage will be offloaded to a decentralized network of hundreds of thousands of storage provider nodes (pNodes), supervised by Xandeum-enabled Solana validators. PNodes, validators, & liquid stakers will earn additional rewards in SOL, thanks to highly dynamic fee markets designed to optimize storage efficiency and profitability." Worldcoin, the blockchain identity network known for its iris-scanning orbs as well as its affiliation with OpenAI founder Sam Altman, introduced Face Auth, a new security measure for World ID. According to the team: "Face Auth is a private 1:1 face comparison that ensures only the person who verified their World ID at an orb can use it. It provides increased security for your World ID during actions like online purchases, financial transactions, secure sign-in applications and much more." The Polkadot community released its latest major product, Agile Coretime, as part of the ongoing Polkadot 2.0 upgrade. According to the team: "This new feature represents a significant advancement in how computational resources are allocated and managed within the Polkadot ecosystem... This new approach replaces the previous auction system, in which single cores were leased for two years at a time." Accoding to the project documentation: "Agile Coretime allows for the purchase of coretime in 'bulk,' with an allocation for one month. Heavy duty parachains which need to author a block every 12 seconds (or every six seconds through Asynchronous Backing), can seamlessly 'renew' the core each month. Coretime renewal orders take precedence over new orders and provide protection against price fluctuations, allowing parachains to plan their project budget and costs more effectively. The purchased coretime can also be split up and sold in parts, down to a single block per month, allowing for secondary markets to thrive and improve the allocation efficiency of coretime." Core usage before, with Polkadot 1.0: After, with Polkadot 2.0 and Agile Coretime: Privado ID, formerly Polygon ID, which has established proofs-of-concept with several multinational banking and financial service companies, announced a strategic merger with Disco, a pioneer in multichain verifiable data and reputation management. According to the team: "The merger will propel the development and adoption of a unified, chain-agnostic digital identity infrastructure spanning both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, and for the first time see Privado ID become available in chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base and others with Privado ID's own established partnerships and scalable infrastructure." The press release stated: "By leveraging Disco’s Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Privado ID enhances cross-chain compatibility enabling it to expand its services across multiple EVM-compatible chains." Midnight Network, a new layer-1 data protection blockchain, has released its litepaper, “Nightpaper." The paper aims to "demonstrate how the network enables apps that protect user, commercial and transaction metadata. The Nightpaper explains how Midnight has solved a new blockchain trilemma: using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for utility without compromising data protection or ownership." Solana Labs's phone designing subsidiary is slated to ship its second crypto phone in 2025, Solana Mobile announced at the Token 2049 conference on Thursday. Called Seeker, the upcoming handheld will be a major hardware improvement over Solana's first mobile phone, with better battery, a stronger camera and a lighter design than the Saga, said Emmet Hollyer, who runs Solana Labs' phonemaking project. CoinDesk 20 asset: (SOL) Civic, developer of a tokenized identity solution on the verifiable web, has partnered with Rentality, described as the first Web3 car rental platform, "to securely verify drivers' licenses and enforce age minimums on the Base network." According to the team: "Using Civic's ID Verification Pass, users can verify licenses virtually, streamlining the car rental process. This solution enhances security, trust and compliance in car rentals and peer-to-peer marketplaces by eliminating the need for physical verification and reducing friction in the transaction, setting a new standard for secure rentals." Chromia, a blockchain ecosystem that aims to avoid network congestion partly by giving every decentralized app (dapp) its own cluster of nodes and computational resources, announced the upcoming "Asgard" mainnet upgrade on the TOKEN2049 stage, along with a $20 million Data and AI Ecosystem Fund. According to the team: "The fund is aimed at supporting data-intensive projects and AI-enabled applications. Asgard, scheduled for Q4 2024, will introduce 'Extensions' – customized chains designed to bring new functionalities to the platform such as oracles, computation for AI models, support for data availability and ZK proofs." Jade City, a RWA platform specifically designed for tokenization of the $50 billion-plus jade market, released its white paper. According to the team: "The Jade City white paper outlines how the new platform will kick off a new era of RWA tokenization when it launches later in 2024, detailing its supply and value chain, supply and distribution partners, revenue and token model, and ongoing roadmap." According to the white paper: "The economy of Jade City is powered by a community-funded value chain. The Jade City community gains access to raw material by purchasing a treasury bond with a stablecoin such as USDT. These funds are used to acquire jade early in the value chain. In return, part of the profit generated from processing and sales is given back to bond holders in the form of tokenized physical jade. The majority of the remaining profit is used to buy. and burn the $JCT token, channeling value to the token holders." The project was co-founded by the owners of the largest jade deposit, the paper reads. According to a spokesperson, the project is being built on Base, with a beta platform expected in early October. ChainOpera AI, a decentralized and open AI platform, has emerged from stealth, according to the team. The project is "launching its decentralized platform and app marketplace that enables developers to build, train, and deploy AI applications using fully decentralized resources. While existing decentralized AI solutions focus on infrastructure like GPUs, they still rely on centralized providers like AWS. ChainOpera fills this gap by delivering enterprise-grade AI models and decentralized infrastructure, providing cost-effective GPU access, community-sourced AI training, and a marketplace for apps built on its decentralized infrastructure." Oasis Network, designed to be a scalable, privacy-first and versatile layer-1 blockchain, has launched liquid staking in partnership with Accumulated Finance, according to the team: "ROSE token holders can now stake their assets while keeping them liquid for trading or use in DeFi applications. This new feature, powered by the Oasis Sapphire ecosystem, provides stROSE, a liquid staking token, allowing users to earn rewards and engage with decentralized apps. Improvements include boosted staking APR and a reduced unbonding period." Users no longer have a 14-day unbonding period when converting staked ROSE to unstaked ROSE, a blog post reads. MatrixPort, a digital asset services platform, and exSat, a docking layer for Bitcoin scalability, plan to work together to introduce nBTC, a wrapped bitcoin alternative, "to improve liquidity and enable diverse financial applications such as staking and lending," according to the team: MatrixPort "will leverage its technology and user base, while exSat focuses on indexing UTXO data. The strategic partnership is set to position exSat as the biggest among Bitcoin L2s, with ~$400 million at launch." RedStone, a leading provider of blockchain oracles, announced the integration of its data feeds into the TON (The Open Network) blockchain. According to the team: "This integration empowers developers and users with fast, gas-efficient and secure data solutions. It is the first and only oracle solution to offer price feeds for TON. By continually expanding its data feeds to meet the evolving demands of the TON ecosystem and deploying production infrastructure to support high-demand asset prices, RedStone is dedicated to fostering the continued growth of TON’s DeFi landscape." Aethir and GameCentric announced a collaboration to enhance Web3 gaming using Aethir’s decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure. According to the team: "This integration boosts GameCentric’s scalability, security, and performance, supporting its expansion into in-game tokens, non-custodial wallets, and a marketplace. This collaboration enables GameCentric to lead in emerging markets while elevating player experiences across Web2 and Web3." Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange, Fortune reported on Thursday. The round was led by led by Multicoin Capital. Drift plans to build an array of financial services tools, including spot and derivatives trading and a predictions market to become the "Robinhood of crypto," co-founder Cindy Leow said, according to the report. The company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year.

	title: Prediction Markets Go to Washington('s Appeals Court)
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-20-2024 16:00:00
	content: The CFTC is working to ban political prediction markets. Its current goal: Get a federal appeals court to keep one from launching while it argues a judge was mistaken in overturning its rejection of Kalshi. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. It's unclear whether political prediction markets will launch in the U.S. before the election (I'm not counting Kalshi's 8-hour effort last week). The ball's in an appeals court to make a decision one way or another, and a 2.5-hour hearing on Thursday elicited few clues about where the judges may land. While Kalshi's prediction markets aren't directly crypto-related, if Kalshi does win the ability to list and trade political event contracts, it may open the door for other providers to enter – or possibly re-enter – the U.S. market. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the middle of a rulemaking process to ban political prediction markets in the U.S. entirely by formally adding these types of event contracts to the definition of "gaming." That effort took a major blow last week, when District of Columbia District Judge Jia Cobb ruled against the regulator in Kalshi v. CFTC. Some quick background: Kalshi tried to self-certify political prediction markets in 2023, but the CFTC ordered that the company could not list or trade those products. Kalshi sued, and on Sept. 6, the judge ruled that Kalshi won – though she didn't actually publish her opinion explaining the ruling until Sept. 12. The full opinion goes into detail about how the judge assessed the CFTC's definition of "gaming" and "involves" as they pertain to the statute (the Commodity Exchange Act) the regulator used to reject the products. The CFTC filed an emergency stay for appeal hours after Kalshi launched its new contracts, willing at least a temporary halt while the appeals court judges consider the emergency motion. As of the time I'm writing this, the contracts are still halted. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for Thursday, giving each party 15 minutes to make its case – though ultimately it ran for some 2.5 hours. We'll presumably find out if the contracts can restart before the election happens after the hearing, but there's no firm timeline here. And of course, there's still the broader question about the appeal itself and how that may go. The broader picture, of course, is the CFTC's ongoing rulemaking around the role of political prediction markets in the U.S. The CFTC's view is it shouldn't be responsible for overseeing these because it'd be too difficult for the regulator to police the underlying market – i.e. the results of the U.S. elections – for fraud and manipulation. The markets themselves may be subject to manipulation through the use of misleading or false polling data, CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz argued in court Thursday. And manipulation on prediction markets may further undermine confidence in elections themselves. Kalshi's view is these concerns are besides the point, because Congress authorized the CFTC to block certain types of event contracts and election markets aren't on the list. "Their argument comes down to characterizing these event contracts as involving either gaming or unlawful activity," said Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth. "The problem as to both is that the Commission's interpretations of how the statute works and how this link what this language means are so broad that they would sweep all event contracts, thereby rendering the other enumerated activity superfluous and flipping the whole structure of how this statute works. And they have not been able to give a limiting principle." Roth represents Kalshi in its case against the CFTC. Schwartz pointed to the Commodity Exchange Act and its preemption of state laws in his argument, noting that some states have laws banning election wagers. The CEA preempts state law, so allowing Kalshi to list political event contracts may run into conflicts with those laws, in one hypothetical. The judges grilled both attorneys, seemingly unimpressed by either over the course of the 2.5-hour hearing (which was originally set to last 30 minutes). It remains to be seen how they'll rule on the temporary stay.

	title: Consensys Suit Against U.S. SEC Dismissed by Texas Court
	author: Jesse Hamilton
	published_at: 09-20-2024 15:48:21
	content: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had – for a time – added Consensys to a list of crypto investigation targets, prompting the technology incubator company to sue it for overreach in federal court. Because the regulator then shut down that Ethereum probe earlier this year, a Texas judge has decided the lack of immediate danger means the lawsuit is unwarranted. Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted in a Thursday filing that "because withholding consideration subjects plaintiff to scant, if any, hardship, the claim lacks a ripe case or controversy." In other words, since there's no clear future threat to Consensys, there's no point in this judge weighing in. "In a significant win for the industry, the SEC dropped its 'Ethereum 2.0' investigation after our litigation was filed, and the Texas court today recognized that the SEC already gave Consensys the relief it sought on that critical issue for the Ethereum ecosystem," the company said in a post on X. Read More: SEC Ends Probe Into Consensys, Won't Sue Over Ethereum Consensys argued that its lawsuit "laid bare the overzealous investigation of Ethereum, and policymakers and the public at large voiced deep concern over the SEC’s investigation of blockchain software development." A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the case being dismissed. When Consensys sued the agency in April, it asked the court to declare that Ethereum's ether (ETH) is not a security and that any investigation of ConsenSys based on the idea that the token is a security would trample on the company's rights. It also contended that MetaMask is not a broker under federal law and that its staking service doesn't violate securities law. After backing down in the ETH investigation, the SEC did follow up with charges against Consensys later in June, alleging that the company's MetaMask service was acting as an unregistered securities broker. While the SEC hasn't made a public statement about ETH's status, last week, the regulator settled charges with eToro which let the trading platform continue listing ETH in the U.S. UPDATE (September 20, 2022, 18:16 UTC): Adds decline to comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	title: MicroStrategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings With $458M Purchase, Upsized Convertible Note Offering to $1B
	author: Krisztian  Sandor
	published_at: 09-20-2024 14:19:49
	content: Nasdaq-listed software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Friday that it purchased 7,420 bitcoin (BTC) for about $458.2 million using the proceeds of its debt offering. The acquisition happened between Sept. 13 and 19 at an average BTC price of approximately $61,750. The company increased its convertible note issuance that concluded Thursday to $1.01 billion from the $700 million principal offering announced earlier this week, according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's bitcoin yield, a novel metric that measures the percentage change in the company's BTC holdings relative to its assumed fully diluted shares outstanding, increased to 5.1% for this quarter, up from 4.4% on September 13, company filings show. The company, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has been a pioneer for bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset, and has become the largest corporate holder of BTC since it started buying in 2020. With the latest purchase, the firm now holds 252,220 bitcoin worth nearly $16 billion at current prices, acquiring at an average BTC price of $39,266 for a total cost of $9.9 billion. The firm still has some $889 million left from its $2 billion ATM equity issuance to acquire more BTC, per last week's regulatory filing. MicroStrategy's shares were down 1.5% from Thursday's market closing price, with U.S. equity indices and BTC also sliding lower. Other public companies such as Semler Scientific, miner Marathon Digital and Japanese investment adviser Metaplanet recently have followed MicroStrategy's footprints to issue debt to accumulate BTC.

	content: The YouTube channel of India’s Supreme Court was compromised on Friday in a first such incident for the judicial body. The channel, which otherwise streams court cases for viewers and the press, showed videos promoting XRP tokens. Its name was changed to “Ripple.live24.” A blank video titled "Brad Garlinghouse: Ripple Responds To The SEC's $2 Billion Fine! XRP PRICE PREDICTION" went live on the channel in the European morning hours. The video and the channel were taken down shortly afterward. “This is to inform all concerned that the YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India has been taken down. The services on YouTube channel of Supreme Court of India will be resumed shortly,” the Supreme Court said in a statement shared with local media companies. The compromise came ahead of several crucial cases scheduled for Friday, the Times of India reported. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

	title: Jump's 'Frankendancer' Validator Client Is Live on Solana Mainnet
	author: Danny Nelson
	published_at: 09-20-2024 07:50:25
	content: SINGAPORE — An early version of Jump Crypto's highly anticipated Solana validator, Firedancer, is live and contributing to the performance of the Solana blockchain, Jump's Chief Science Officer Kevin Bowers said Friday. Speaking onstage at Solana's Breakpoint conference, Bowers shed light on an "open secret" in Solana's validator community: Some of the computing power underpinning Solana is running "Frankendancer" software that combines predominant validator tech with new contributions from Jump. Blockchain validators ingest transactions and construct blocks – the most essential process in running a blockchain. Most networks have a single validator client. Solana's plan to have two fully independent validators – one from a Solana spinoff team, Anza, one from Jump – would give it a redundancy boost, and potentially a performance edge, too. Such behind-the-scenes and in-the-weeds tech developments might seem like a yawner, but at Breakpoint it received top billing. The sellout conference's largest stage was standing room only as Bowers emerged to a rockstar-like atmosphere. "We view this project as the consumer science equivalent of civil engineering," Bowers said of the effort to build the second validator client. He compared the potential impact of Firedancer as akin to expanding a country road into an interstate highway. Bowers shed little light on when Firedancer – the fully new client software, as opposed to Frankendancer – would come online. But it is running on testnet, Bowers said, indicating it has achieved minimum viability and is getting close. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: SocGen's Crypto Unit Takes Euro Stablecoin to Solana After Flopping on Ethereum
	author: Danny Nelson
	published_at: 09-20-2024 07:00:00
	content: SINGAPORE – SG Forge, a subsidiary of Societe Generale, will roll out euro stablecoin EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) on the Solana blockchain, the French financial services firm said Friday. SG Forge launched EURCV on the Ethereum blockchain last year as a highly regulated, euro-centric alternative to top dollar-linked stablecoins from Tether and Circle. It has struggled to catch on: EURCV has only 28 holders, 154 lifetime transactions and an issuance of 33 million, according to its Etherscan page. The Solana debut will test whether crypto users have any appetite for Euro-linked stablecoins on a faster and cheaper network, two attributes SG Forge touted in a press release. CEO Jean-Marc Stenger said in the presser that Solana's speed "will unlock new possibilities for both retail users and institutional players in" decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins are becoming systemically important to the global financial economy, Bernstein wrote in a recent report. Myriad firms are eager to replicate the success of Circle and Tether, the largest stablecoin issuers who collect major windfalls from ownership of the Treasury notes underlying their respective assets.

	title: Crypto Exchange BingX Hacked, Onchain Data Shows Over $43M Drained
	author: Sam Reynolds

	content: Crypto exchange BingX has been hacked for a "minor" amount of assets and the exchange plans to compensate users for any loss, the firm's chief product officer (CPO) said in a message on X. On-chain data suggests nearly $43 million was stolen from the exchange in multiple tranches, with $13.25 million ether, $2.3 million BNB, $4.4 million USDT, among other being drained. The first hack was for approximately $26 million, while a few hours afterward, hackers took an additional $16.5 million from the exchange. "The total loss is minimal and manageable. This incident will not affect our ongoing business operations," BingX CPO Vivien Lien said on X. "Trading services continue as usual. Withdrawals and deposits are temporarily delayed and are expected to be restored within 24 hours at the latest." Aside from stablecoins, hackers took more than 360 different types of altcoins. Data from Etherscan shows most of the stolen crypto was swapped for ETH and BNB at DEXs like Uniswap and Kyberswap. As of press time the wallet tied to the hack, which Etherscan says received most of its funds from the BingX hot wallet, has over 1,000 ether in it and tokens worth $5 million.

	title: Crypto Investment Firm Deus X Capital Unveils DeFi Unit Which Will Start New Yield Generating Protocol
	author: Will Canny
	published_at: 09-20-2024 00:00:00
	content: Deus X Capital, the $1 billion investment and operating company led by Tim Grant, today launched Solstice Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) business, the company said in a press release on Friday. Solstice Labs is building institutional-grade DeFi products and protocols that will be available to all investors, the company said. The business' first project is a protocol that offers enhanced yield opportunities, and is expected to go live in early 2025, Deus X said. It aims to deliver stable and consistent yields for investors, Ben Nadareski, co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview, and in a democratized fashion, as all users will have the same access to this yield generating opportunity on the Solstice protocol. The protocol will be developed on the Solana blockchain, and is expected to launch with more than $100 million of total value locked (TVL), with significant investment from Deus X Capital. Nadareski, who is currently an investment director at Deus X Capital, is co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs. Tim Grant, CEO of Deus X Capital will be co-founder and chairman of the company. Stuart Connolly, chief investment officer at Deus X and CEO of Alpha Lab 40, is to join the firm as chief investment officer and co-founder. "Many DeFi products and protocols have been built using exceptional technology stacks like we have seen with Solana but have largely been overlooked for institutional applications," said Nadareski, in the release. "This presents a huge opportunity to introduce institutional-grade yield-opportunities and infrastructure into DeFi which will allow for a far broader range of investment participation," he added. Solstice Labs will work closely with Cor Prime, a prime broker, and Alpha Lab 40, a proprietary trading firm, both of which are portfolio companies of Deus X Capital. Cor Prime launched on Wednesday with a $100 million commitment of risk capital from Deus X Capital, and the company plans to address the supply/demand imbalance for leverage in the crypto market. Deus X Capital launched in October last year with $1 billion of assets, including existing investments and capital to be deployed.

	title: U.S. Election Betting: CFTC, Kalshi Both Grilled by Judges in Appeals Court
	author: Nikhilesh De
	published_at: 09-19-2024 22:06:11
	content: A panel of judges grilled attorneys for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and prediction-betting platform Kalshi over the company's efforts to launch political prediction markets in the U.S., without indicating whether they'd allow Kalshi to offer these products while reviewing a lower court's ruling on the products. CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz and Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth took turns explaining why an appeals court should or should not block Kalshi from listing these events contracts. The Thursday hearing came days after a federal judge ruled that the CFTC could not block Kalshi from listing political prediction markets, letting the company list contracts predicting how control of the House and Senate might play out. But it only lasted for a few hours, since the CFTC quickly filed for an emergency stay, which the appeals court granted on a temporary basis. During the 2.5-hour hearing, the judges did not seem especially impressed by either party, saying various arguments or explanations did not make sense and drilling into specific terms of the Commodity Exchange Act and what they mean. The judges did not get to asking what an event contract actually is until more than two hours into the hearing. The CFTC's Schwartz called D.C. District Court Judge Jia Cobb's Sept. 12 ruling "seriously flawed," and said it could allow Kalshi – and other companies – to immediately launch "high-stakes" betting markets. "If that happens, the harm to the public is going to be profound at a time, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but Americans broadly believe that our democracy is under threat," Schwartz said. "In order to obtain a stay, the commission has to show two things: merit, and that there will be some harm, irreparable harm, absent the stay, and they can't make either of those," Roth said in his opening statement. Kalshi saw $50,000 deposited in its two political events contracts in the eight hours or so that the products were live before the CFTC filed for an emergency stay, Roth said. The CFTC's arguments revolve around the agency's stated inability to police the underlying events – namely, U.S. elections. Market participants could distort markets to suggest one candidate is doing better than another, Schwartz said, and it would be more difficult to correct than other markets. A judge posed the hypothetical question of whether a counterparty might take the other side of a bet made for manipulative purposes: "Somebody will take the other side and eat their lunch. Is that what's supposed to happen?" That is what should happen, but political prediction markets may be susceptible to manipulation that cannot be easily corrected, Schwartz said. "It's because the sources of information that they absorb and reflect are opaque and unreliable. I am talking about polls with undisclosed methodologies, so, bad methodologies, fake polls, pollsters with agendas, inaccurate news, fake news, on and on," he said. "Normal futures contracts have an objective indicator that is reliable, kind of a published index report." If these markets are manipulated, that would both harm the market participants and could even undermine election integrity, Schwartz said. Later in the hearing, he drew a distinction between political event contracts and other types of bets that could be placed. "There's really very little monkeying around you can do with an earthquake," Schwartz said, responding to one example. Roth, speaking on Kalshi's behalf, pushed back, saying the more robust a market is, the less susceptible it would be to that type of manipulation. He pointed to the $1 billion already bet on Polymarket, which does not offer services in the U.S. after a settlement with the CFTC, saying the regulator's argument essentially suggests having an overseas vendor provide these products may be better than Kalshi doing so. "The most important thing I want to make is that the way to reduce that risk is to allow Kalshi markets to offer because right now, this activity is happening and being reported to voters based on markets that are not regulated, that are open to foreign traders, that have no surveillance. … There's no transparency," he said. "We don't know who's buying, who's selling cryptocurrency. If this was happening on Kalshi's markets, we would have this whole suite of regulatory provisions that apply." The CFTC needed to show there was a risk of "irreparable harm" in allowing Kalshi to continue listing and trading its events contracts. Todd Phillips, an assistant professor of law at the Georgia State University Robinson College of Business, told CoinDesk it was "unclear if [the CFTC] did that" over the course of the hearing. The regulator could have done a better job explaining what event contracts actually are and how a state prohibiting gambling on elections counts as gaming for the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act, he said. On the other hand, Kalshi also faced tough questioning from the panel of judges on the appeals court. "Kalshi is making an argument that 'you should allow us to do something that 29 states prohibit, and that's big," he said. "That would be effectively overturning the law in more than half the country. Marc Hochstein contributed reporting. Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: German Government Shuts Down 47 Exchanges, Says They're Tied To ‘Illegal Activity’
	author: Helene Braun
	published_at: 09-19-2024 20:46:21
	content: The German Attorney General's Office Frankfurt am Main (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) and the country’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) have shut down 47 crypto exchanges allegedly tied to criminal activities including money laundering. The exchanges purposefully failed to comply with their obligation to carry out certain identity and background checks on their customers, also known as “know your customer” (KYC) requirements, the BKA said in a press release on Thursday. Some of the exchanges include Xchange.cash, 60cek.org, Baksman.com, alongside other smaller platforms. One of the exchanges had been active since 2012 while others had launched as recently as the previous year. Some customer and transaction data was seized by the government in the process of the investigation, it said. Given that the people behind those activities often reside in other countries outside of Germany, where criminal activities like this are “tolerated or even protected,” the authorities noted it may be nearly impossible for German government officials to prosecute them. Instead, they will focus on “weakening” the underlying infrastructure that allowed for those illegal activities, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the BKA seized 49,857 bitcoin (BTC), worth $2.1 billion at the time, from the operators of a privacy website called Movie2k.to, which was shut down in 2013 for violating the Copyright Act. The agency proceeded to sell the tokens in July, causing distress in the global crypto markets due to the selling pressure resulting from the dump as well as the simultaneous repayments by defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which happened around the same time. Edited by Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Does SBF’s Appeal Stand a Chance of Succeeding?
	author: Ben Schiller
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:34:23
	content: It’s been about 10 months since Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the collapse of FTX. It’s been about six months since he was sentenced (in March) to 25 years in federal prison. In that time, the crypto industry has moved on: markets are up, VC dollars are back, and politicians are once again supporting the industry. Meanwhile, the mainstream media has almost forgotten about the fallen crypto king, SBF himself.  So might a judge and jury see SBF’s case differently should it hear evidence from the FTX founder again? That certainly seems to be the hope of SBF’s new legal team, which took over his case after his trial lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, stepped down following his conviction. On Friday, Sept. 13, his new lead lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, filed an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, laying out why SBF believes he deserves another hearing. “In the United States, people accused of crimes are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” Shapiro's appeal begins. “They are entitled to a fair trial by a jury. When the government introduces evidence, defendants have the right to rebut that evidence and present their side of the story. That, at least, is how it’s supposed to work. But none of that happened here.” The 102-page document argues that SBF was unfairly treated at trial, which took place as public scrutiny of the FTX case reached a fever pitch. Shapiro argues SBF was “presumed guilty by federal prosecutors eager for quick headlines,” “presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial,” and that the “prevailing narrative” of FTX’s collapse, and SBF’s part in it, was accepted as true, without proper inquiry. “From day one, the prevailing narrative—initially spun by the lawyers who took over FTX, quickly adopted by their contacts at the U.S. Attorney’s Office—was that Bankman-Fried had stolen billions of dollars of customer funds, driven FTX to insolvency, and caused billions in losses,” the appeal continues. “Now, nearly two years later, a very different picture is emerging—one confirming FTX was never insolvent, and in fact had assets worth billions to repay its customers. But the jury at BankmanFried’s trial never got to see that picture.” SBF has long maintained that FTX was never really insolvent and it was forced into bankruptcy unnecessarily. It notes that, under the bankruptcy settlement, nearly all its customers are being made whole. Shapiro says Judge Lewis A. Kaplan deprived the jury of “Brady” evidence favorable to the defendant, including that SBF made good investments (such as in Anthropic, the AI startup) alongside the bad ones. However, lawyers contacted by CoinDesk were skeptical that SBF would win a retrial, given the high bar for such legal turnovers. “It’s just not very common for an appellate court to double-guess a case like this,” said Tama Beth Kudman, partner at Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner. SBF’s lawyers would have to prove not only that Kaplan was biased against SBF, she said, and also that such bias led to actions that were prejudicial against SBF. To allow the appeal to go forward, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals would be saying effectively that it thought the judge in the original case acted inappropriately – something it rarely does, Kudman said. The appeals court might order a retrial if SBF's lawyers could show that Kaplan had a personal conflict of interest. But there’s no evidence for that, thus far. “Kaplan is known as a well-tempered, good natured judge. I would have thought he would have stepped aside if there was any reason that he shouldn’t be hearing the case,” Kudman said. Joshua Ashley Klayman, the U.S. head of fintech and head of blockchain and digital assets at Linklaters, said the appeal may have been timed to coincide with sentencing for Caroline Ellison, SBF’s former colleague and sometime lover. U.S. government lawyers have not requested jail time for Ellison, noting that the SBF case would have been “difficult to prove” without her testimony. Shapiro may be trying to juxtapose SBF’s steep sentencing with Ellison’s much lighter penalty. “Without expressing a view on the likelihood of success of Sam Bankman-Fried’s appeal, the timing of his filing may be strategic," Klayman said. "SBF’s appeal was filed on September 13, 2024, three days after the filing of Caroline Ellison’s sentencing memorandum. SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison’s counsel has requested a non-custodial sentence." Klayman said news that FTX creditors are being repaid could help SBF's legal team. “The mainstream media has reported on FTX’s plans to repay customers. Perhaps SBF and his counsel may hope that, with the passage of time, SBF’s arguments [that FTX customers didn’t lose money] may be viewed in a different light." Joe Valenti, partner in the White Collar & Government Enforcement practice at law firm Saul Ewing, says appeals courts tend to give significant discretion to judges in weighing evidence, provided they meet a basic standard of reasonableness. "Anything that's tied to the reading of the facts, or the conduct of the courtroom, they give significant leeway to the court," he said. Judges are allowed to control the courtroom in the interest of expeditious justice and limiting evidence from being admitted to the record is well within the discretion of the judge. As for the argument that customers are being made whole in bankruptcy, Valenti doesn't see that argument holding much water either. "It doesn't matter if the money was paid back. If you're a cashier at the supermarket and you take $20 to go to the casino, it doesn’t matter if you give back the money the next day. You still took money from the grocery store."

	title: Ethereum Developers Confirm Plan to Split 'Pectra' Upgrade In Two
	author: Margaux Nijkerk
	published_at: 09-19-2024 19:15:58
	content: Ethereum developers agreed on Thursday to split their upcoming hard fork, Pectra, into two packages, in a move to make the massive upgrade less unwieldy and reduce the risk of missteps or bugs. The decision to split up the upgrade wasn't unexpected. Developers had discussed previously that Pectra was becoming too ambitious to ship all at once, floating the idea of splitting it up in order to minimize the risk of finding bugs in the code. Pectra was on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork is the technical term for when a blockchain splits from its original, and is the method used by Ethereum to implement major software upgrades.) Now, developers will be able to focus on a much narrower scope. Previously, developers shared they would aim to have the upgrade live in early 2025; that is still the case for the first part of the Pectra package. The core developers decided that eight Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) will be included in the first package, which includes EIP-7702, aimed at improving the user-experience of wallets, and famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes. The second package is up to be changed over the next few months, but as of now could include proposals that aim to make changes to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, known as EOF, along with introducing a feature called PeerDAS, which improves data availability sampling and ultimately is beneficial for layer-2 blockchains. The developers acknowledged that the scopes of these upgrades can change over time, so solidifying this upgrade wouldn't be wise in this moment. "There seems to be agreements to split current Pectra somehow," said Ethereum Foundation researcher Alex Stokes, who led the call. "And then downstream, we can figure out what comes next." “I hear everyone that, it can be tricky to not want to put new things in. I would lean towards, again, keeping the scope very small, just because then that's going to maximize our chances of actually shipping the second fork very quickly with respect to this first one,” Stokes added.

This is Crypto for Advisors, after all, so in today’s issue, Roxanna Islam from TMX VettaFi takes us through crypto demand and adoption since the launch of spot ETFs in the U.S. In Ask an Expert, Bryan Courchesne, CEO of DAIM, looks at whether advisors are supporting their clients investments in crypto and, if not, where the risks lie. – Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. Many of us thought that the launch of spot crypto ETFs would help bring crypto into the mainstream and encourage adoption - particularly by closing the gap between advisors and their clients. While the spot bitcoin ETF launch in January broke records, demand for spot Ethereum ETFs has been muted. And now with no near-term approval for Solana ETFs, this raises the question – does interest in crypto ETFs end with bitcoin? I believe there will be more to the crypto ETF story, but there are three big questions we need to answer about demand. 1. Are clients ACTUALLY interested in crypto? Seasoned crypto investors see the benefit of investing directly in cryptocurrencies – not just bitcoin. However, crypto ETFs brought access to other groups of investors, including retail investors who are newer to crypto and more comfortable with a traditional vehicle like an ETF. And unlike the old-school crypto investor, newer investors may be satisfied with a simpler approach to cryptocurrency investing (i.e., investing in just bitcoin ETFs). Despite the fact that bitcoin and ether (symbol ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) have two very different use cases, it is very easy to use bitcoin as a “just for fun” investment without fully diversifying their crypto allocation. This has been reflected in net flows for crypto launches. Excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $37.3 billion in net inflows since their launch in January, with net inflows for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bringing in $20.9 billion of those flows. Since their launch in July, spot ether ETFs have seen net inflows of only $2.1 billion (excluding the flagship Grayscale product). The highest inflows were seen in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), which had only $1.0 billion net inflows – a significant gap from its spot bitcoin counterpart. While I believe interest in spot Ether will grow over time, these trends indicate that mainstream investors still haven’t fully embraced crypto. 2. Are advisors WILLING to allocate to crypto? Given a niche portion of clients interested in crypto ETFs, the next step is making sure advisors are also open to conversation. The survey results shown below are important because 64% of advisors surveyed—that’s almost two-thirds of advisors—are neutral to negative on cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bloomberg Terminal data show that the majority of investors who own spot crypto products are self-directed investors—not those who invest through an advisor. According to this data, 80% of shares held of iShares’ (IBIT) and 75% of shares held of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) are by investors who do not file 13Fs (i.e., self-directed clients). Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut answer to getting advisors more interested in this asset class. Education – not just for investors, but also focused on advisors – will be the primary solution. Education takes time but should become easier as time passes and ease acceptance among both clients and advisors. 3. CAN advisors allocate to crypto? Assuming both clients and advisors are interested, there are still some barriers to investing. Many large brokerage firms and asset managers do not allow investment in crypto including crypto ETFs. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has stated on their website that they do not allow crypto ETFs on their platform because they “do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios.” Similarly, Edward Jones released guidance stating that “cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and [they] don’t offer a way to purchase or hold cryptocurrencies” including crypto funds. While Morgan Stanley recently started allowing their financial advisors to offer bitcoin ETFs, there is a significant caveat. They can only offer the two largest funds – Blackrock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC – and these can only be offered to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million with aggressive risk tolerance. These are likely the most difficult barriers to overcome because they can’t simply be solved by education, but persistent investor and advisor demand should reduce these barriers over time. Bottom Line: Crypto ETFs have come a long way, and I still believe the industry has room to move forward. But we need to address education to encourage adoption and bridge the gap between advisors and their clients. - Roxanna Islam, CFA, CAIA, Head of Sector & Industry Research, TMX VettaFi  Q. Can advisors help their clients with crypto investments? It can be challenging for financial advisors to meet the needs of clients when it comes to investing in digital assets. The landscape of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is rapidly evolving, and the learning curve for traditional advisors is steep. From understanding the complexities of the crypto market to managing the risks associated with digital assets, the journey can be overwhelming. Many advisors may not even have the capability to invest in a bitcoin ETF, let alone feel comfortable discussing it with clients. As a result, clients often find themselves navigating the crypto market alone, without the guidance of their trusted financial advisor. Q. How does it impact clients who don’t have advisors help? This disconnect can lead to significant problems for investors. Without proper guidance, clients may invest in the wrong asset at the wrong time, resulting in substantial losses. Improper portfolio weighting toward cryptocurrencies can also expose investors to unnecessary risk, while the potential for fraud in the crypto space remains a constant threat. These pitfalls can create a sense of distrust and uncertainty around digital assets, causing many to wonder whether they should avoid the space altogether. Q. What’s the risk to not learning about crypto? So, as it stands, advisors are not meeting client needs. This will leave clients under-allocated at a time when the asset is still experiencing outperformance relative to traditional assets. The opportunity cost of forgoing significant alpha could significantly impair client performance over the long run. It is crucial for advisors to realize the time is now to position their clients for future success. It’s time for advisors to educate themselves on this asset class and pass on what they learn to clients. Remember, as an advisor, a diversified portfolio does not need a significant allocation to crypto. A 5-10% allocation to bitcoin can go a long way. We are not there yet, but hopefully, the tide is turning. - Bryan Courchesne, CEO, DAIM  Edited by Bradley Keoun.

	title: Police Arrest Two People Related to $243M Crypto Heist Targeting Genesis Creditor
	author: Oliver Knight

	content: Two people have been arrested following an investigation into a $243 million heist in which the accused thieves allegedly sought to pass thousands of bitcoin through mixing services, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a Thursday statement. On Aug. 19, a creditor of defunct trading firm Genesis fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering scam after being contacted by a spoofed number that posed as a member of Google support, according to information first reported by blockchain sleuth ZachXBT. The victim was convinced to reset their Gemini two-factor authentication settings and send funds to a compromised wallet. Transaction tracing analyzed by ZachXBT shows that the $243 million was split across multiple wallets before being sent to more than 15 exchanges. An unsealed indictment on Thursday identified Malone Lam, 20, a citizen of Singapore who lives in Miami and Los Angeles, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, of Los Angeles, showing both had been arrested Wednesday night and charged with conspiring to steal and launder the cryptocurrency. They were set to appear in separate federal courts in California and Florida on Thursday, according to the Justice Department. A cluster of the stolen funds allegedly flowed into luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry and designer clothes. The culprits were tied to the loot after they accidentally shared an address that has been used to purchase luxury clothing. CFInvestigators, zeroshadow, ZachXBT and Binance Security used this information to freeze more than $9 million, with $500,000 being returned to the victim. Both Miami and Los Angeles police departments did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. UPDATE (September 19, 2024, 19:44 UTC): Adds confirmation and indictment information from the U.S. Department of Justice. Edited by Aoyon Ashraf and Jesse Hamilton.

	title: Inside OKX's Strategic Shifts to Its Regulatory Approach, Formula 1 Branding and App Design
	author: Amitoj Singh
	published_at: 09-19-2024 13:11:05
	content: Singapore – Crypto exchange OKX has taken a turn of sorts over the past few months. It is rethinking its strategy in three major areas; the look and tech aspects of its application, its approach toward regulation and expansion, and its brand strategy as the primary partner of McLaren Formula 1 Team, OKX CMO Haider Rafique told CoinDesk in an interview. Rafique revealed the behind the scenes action at OKX in the past year at the unveiling of a limited-edition livery design on the McLaren MCL38 F1 race cars as Singapore gears up for its Grand Prix this weekend. The race stands out in the F1 calendar as it indirectly acts as an advertisement for the region. The fastest cars in the world zip past buildings hosting financial institutions, such as DBS and Standard Chartered, both of whom are involved in the crypto ecosystem. The design, titled Legend Reborn, celebrated the iconic MP4 era of McLaren, from 1981 to 1996, honoring its legends Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Niki Lauda. "When we shopped McLaren, they were team number eight on the grid. A lot of people asked the obvious question, was that the right move? Now leading the 2024 Constructors Standings," said Rafique. McLaren last won the constructors' championship, one of the two world championships contested in Formula 1, in 1998. This year, currently, it is in the lead. "People go there to watch the sport, not to look at a crypto commercial," Rafique said. "We should be a brand less about pushing our logo and services and more about helping people get into F1. That's the better way to win hearts and minds and have better recall on our logo exposure." In terms of the app design Haider said while we had "rebranded two years ago, we hadn't done our product justice as the design was quite behind." Predicting that OKX would be "one of the largest web three technology companies," Haider said the company had been quietly working to redesign the look on its app, bringing in new tech aspects making its Web3 and trading experience from the "very black and white brand visually" to appear as a "deep technology brand." Haider also revealed OKX's shift in its thinking toward regulation by narrowing its focus. "We find ourselves in a really unique place. We have been largely known as an offshore exchange, in terms of market perception given where we started, where we have largest market share. But the facts are that now, actually, if you look at the last 12 to 15 months of our company history, we are now becoming more onshore than perhaps any global exchange our size," Haider said. While OKX did pull out of India after planning to enter the region, it has secured regulatory victories in Australia and Singapore, which in particular took more than four years, part of which was the "most difficult," OKX's CEO revealed earlier. Additionally, OKX has hired teams and is offering their products in Brazil, Argentina, Netherlands and Turkey. Plans are afoot for more regulatory victories where efforts had been made for years, Haider said "The decision was to put all our energy in making sure we get the licenses where we invested the most in, otherwise it's just millions of dollars wasted."

	title: Maximizing Bitcoin per Share: A New Corporate Strategy
	author: James Van Straten
	published_at: 09-19-2024 12:26:23
	content: Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a significant treasury asset for public companies, a trend catalyzed by MicroStrategy's (MSTR) decision to incorporate bitcoin into its corporate treasury in August 2020, resulting in an over 800% increase in its stock value. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, public companies hold approximately 354,316 BTC, about 1.69% of the total bitcoin supply of 21 million. This move has inspired a following, with several other companies adopting bitcoin to diversify and protect themselves from inflationary pressures. Notable among these are Metaplanet (3350), Semler Scientific (SMLR) and most recently, Cathedra Bitcoin (CBIT). Cathedra Bitcoin, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada, has made a strategic shift from focusing solely on bitcoin mining to developing and operating data centers. The change comes as the mining industry faces increasing challenges due to the bitcoin halving. The Hashrate index, which tracks bitcoin mining revenue, is at a relatively low 43 (petahash/second) PH/s, with an all-time low of 36 PH/s, causing many public miners to struggle in 2024. Cathedra's goal is now to maximize bitcoin holdings per share by moving away from mining to create a more sustainable cash flow. This pivot allows the company to continuously acquire more bitcoin, focusing on long-term growth in bitcoin holdings rather than costly operational ventures. "Going forward, we will make all capital allocation decisions with the intention of maximizing our shareholders’ per-share bitcoin holdings," the company said. Also active in the bitcoin treasury arena is Metaplanet, led by CEO Simon Gerovich. Similar to Cathedra, Metaplanet is also prioritizing growth in its bitcoin holdings. Gerovich has emphasized the company's goal of boosting its holdings each month, a strategy that has led to significant gains. Year-to-date, Metaplanet's stock value has increased by 587%, reflecting the market's positive response to its strategic approach. MicroStrategy remains a pioneer and the most significant participant in the bitcoin treasury space. Under Michael Saylor's leadership, the company continues to innovate and expand bitcoin adoption. On Sept. 18, it announced the pricing of a $875 million convertible senior notes offering, upsized from an initial $700 million. The notes carry a 0.625% interest rate and mature in 2028. The proceeds will be used to redeem $500 million in high-interest 6.125% senior secured notes at a redemption price of 103.063% of the principal amount, reducing the company's interest payments. The remaining funds will be used to buy more bitcoin. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to buy up to an additional $135 million in notes. In a recent 8-K filing, MicroStrategy introduced an innovative concept called "bitcoin yield," which measures the percentage change in the company's bitcoin holdings relative to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, including both Class A and Class B shares. From January 1 to Sept.12 the company's bitcoin yield was 17%, with a quarter-to-date yield of 4.4%. According to the MSTR-tracker, the bitcoin per share ratio is currently about 0.0012. This metric suggests that long-term shareholders are experiencing accretive value in their bitcoin holdings. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

	title: Solana-Based Drift Raises $25M to Build 'SuperApp' for DeFi Trading
	author: Jamie Crawley
	published_at: 09-19-2024 11:46:00
	content: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Drift raised $25 million in Series B funding to expand its Solana-based exchange. The round was led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from Blockchain Capital, Folius Ventures, Maelstrom and Primitive, according to a post on X. Drift wrote on X that it would be the "first on-chain platform to offer cross-collateral margin accounts across a DeFi product suite, spanning perpetual derivatives markets, spot markets, borrow-lend markets and prediction markets." As a decentralized platform, Drift differentiates itself from centralized exchanges in that there is no single entity in control of users' funds. Drift's protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and an associated token, DRIFT, which has risen 2.1% in the last 24 hours to just above $0.71. Solana is the closest competitor to Ethereum, which remains comfortably the biggest blockchain for DeFi activity. The funding news was initially reported by Fortune. Co-founder Cindy Leow told the outlet that she wants Drift to become the "Robinhood of crypto," and that the company intends to double its headcount to 50 within the next year. Leow said she thinks Solana and not Ethereum – currently the dominant blockchain for DeFi in terms total deposits – will ultimately be the best venue for a platform like Drift, because issuers of tokenized assets will "look at the chain that has the highest amount of activity, the highest amount of users, and the most seamless integration."
